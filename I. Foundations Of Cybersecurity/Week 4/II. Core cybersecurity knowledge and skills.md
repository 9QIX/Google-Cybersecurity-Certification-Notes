# Introduction to Linux, SQL, and Python

[[Programming]] to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks. Programming allows analysts to complete repetitive tasks and processes with a high degree of accuracy and efficiency. It also helps reduce the risk of human error, and can save hours or days compared to performing the work manually.

## OS and Programming Languages

- **[[Linux]]** - is an open-source, or publicly available, operating system. Unlike other operating systems you may be familiar with, for example MacOS or Windows, Linux relies on a command line as the primary user interface. Linux itself is not a programming language, but it does allow for the use of text-based commands between the user and the operating system.
	- A common use of Linux for entry-level security analysts is examining [[logs]] to better understand what's occurring in a system. For example, you might find yourself using commands to review an error log when investigating uncommonly high network traffic.
- **[[Structured Query Language (SQL)]]** - is a programming language used to create, interact with, and request information from a database. 
	- A **[[Database]]** is an organized collection of information or data. There may be millions of data points in a database. 
	- So an entry-level security analyst would use SQL to filter through the data points to retrieve specific information. 
- **[[Python]]** - Security professionals can use Python to perform tasks that are repetitive and time-consuming and that require a high level of detail and accuracy.

# Use tools to protect business operations

## Tools and their purposes

### **Programming** 

**[[Programming]]** is a process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks. Security analysts use programming languages, such as Python, to execute automation. 
**[[Automation]]** is the use of technology to reduce human and manual effort in performing common and repetitive tasks. Automation also helps reduce the risk of human error.

Another programming language used by analysts is called **[[Structured Query Language (SQL)]]**. **SQL** is used to create, interact with, and request information from a database. 
A **[[database]]** is an organized collection of information or data. There can be millions of data points in a database. 
A **[[Data Point]]** is a specific piece of information. 

### **Operating systems**

An **[[Operating System]]** is the interface between computer hardware and the user. Linux®, macOS®, and Windows are operating systems. They each offer different functionality and user experiences. 

Previously, you were introduced to **[[Linux]]** as an open-source operating system. 

**[[Open Source]]** means that the code is available to the public and allows people to make contributions to improve the software. 

**[[Linux]]** is not a programming language; however, it does involve the use of a command line within the operating system. 

A **[[Command]]** is an instruction telling the computer to do something. 

A **[[Command-Line Interface]]** is a text-based user interface that uses commands to interact with the computer.

### **Web vulnerability**

A **[[Web Vulnerability]]** is a unique flaw in a web application that a [[threat actor]] could exploit by using malicious code or behavior, to allow unauthorized access, data theft, and malware deployment.

To stay up-to-date on the most critical risks to web applications, review the [Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).

### **Antivirus software**

**[[Antivirus Software]]** is a software program used to prevent, detect, and eliminate malware and viruses. It is also called anti-malware. Depending on the type of antivirus software, it can scan the memory of a device to find patterns that indicate the presence of malware. 

### **Intrusion detection system** 

An **[[Intrusion Detection System (IDS)]]** is an application that monitors system activity and alerts on possible intrusions. The system scans and analyzes network packets, which carry small amounts of data through a network. The small amount of data makes the detection process easier for an IDS to identify potential threats to sensitive data. Other occurrences an IDS might detect can include theft and unauthorized access.

### **Encryption**

**[[Encryption]]** makes data unreadable and difficult to decode for an unauthorized user; its main goal is to ensure confidentiality of private data. **Encryption** is the process of converting data from a readable format to a cryptographically encoded format. 

**[[Cryptographic Encoding]]** means converting plaintext into secure ciphertext. 

**[[Plaintext]]** is unencrypted information and **[[Secure Ciphertext]]** is the result of encryption.  

**Note:** Encoding and encryption serve different purposes. [[Encoding]] uses a public conversion algorithm to enable systems that use different data representations to share information.    

### **Penetration testing** 

**[[Penetration Testing]]**, also called pen testing, is the act of participating in a simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes. It is a thorough risk assessment that can evaluate and identify external and internal threats as well as weaknesses.

## Key takeaways

In this reading, you learned more about programming and operating systems. You were also introduced to several new tools and processes. Every organization selects their own set of tools. Therefore, the more tools you know, the more valuable you are to an organization. Tools help security analysts complete their tasks more efficiently and effectively.

# Create a cybersecurity portfolio

## What is a portfolio, and why is it necessary?

Cybersecurity professionals use [[Portfolios]] to demonstrate their security education, skills, and knowledge. Professionals typically use portfolios when they apply for jobs to show potential employers that they are passionate about their work and can do the job they are applying for. 
[[Portfolios]] are more in depth than a resume, which is typically a one-to-two page summary of relevant education, work experience, and accomplishments. You will have the opportunity to develop a resume, and finalize your portfolio, in the last course of this program. 

## Options for creating your portfolio 

There are many ways to present a portfolio, including self-hosted and online options such as:

- Documents folder
- Google Drive or Dropbox™
- Google Sites
- Git repository

### **Option 1: Documents folder**

**Description:** A documents folder is a folder created and saved to your computer’s hard drive. You manage the folder, subfolders, documents, and images within it. 

Document folders allow you to have direct access to your documentation. Ensuring that your professional documents, images, and other information are well organized can save you a lot of time when you’re ready to apply for jobs. For example, you may want to create a main folder titled something like “Professional documents.” Then, within your main folder, you could create subfolders with titles such as:

- Resume
- Education
- Portfolio documents
- Cybersecurity tools
- Programming 

**Setup:** Document folders can be created in multiple ways, depending on the type of computer you are using. If you’re unsure about how to create a folder on your device, you can search the internet for instructional videos or documents related to the type of computer you use.

### **Option 2: Google Drive or Dropbox**

**Description:** Google Drive and Dropbox offer similar features that allow you to store your professional documentation on a cloud platform. Both options also have file-sharing features, so you can easily share your portfolio documents with potential employers. Any additions or changes you make to a document within that folder will be updated automatically for anyone with access to your portfolio.

Similar to a documents folder, keeping your Google Drive or Dropbox-based portfolio well organized will be helpful as you begin or progress through your career.

**Setup:** To learn how to upload and share files on these applications, visit the Google Drive and Dropbox websites for more information.  

### **Option 3: Google Sites**

**Description:** Google Sites and similar website hosting options have a variety of easy-to-use features to help you present your portfolio items, including customizable layouts, responsive webpages, embedded content capabilities, and web publishing.

Responsive webpages automatically adjust their content to fit a variety of devices and screen sizes. This is helpful because potential employers can review your content using any device and your media will display just as you intend. When you’re ready, you can publish your website and receive a unique URL. You can add this link to your resume so hiring managers can easily access your work.

**Setup:** To learn how to create a website in Google Sites, visit the Google Sites website.  

### **Option 4: Git repository**

**Description:** A Git repository is a folder within a project. In this instance, the project is your portfolio, and you can use your repository to store the documents, labs, and screenshots you complete during each course of the certificate program. There are several Git repository sites you can use, including:

- GitLab
- Bitbucket™
- GitHub

Each Git repository allows you to showcase your skills and knowledge in a customizable space. To create an online project portfolio on any of the repositories listed, you need to use a version of Markdown.  

**Setup:** To learn about how to create a GitHub account and use Markdown, follow the steps outlined in the document [Get started with GitHub](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13nqRTU4H14NFytodh_tbafXthjNRD7aWU_4Cjq7pKG8/template/preview#heading=h.m08l38wqbrm0).

## Portfolio projects #Resume

As previously mentioned, you will have multiple opportunities throughout the certificate program to develop items to include in your portfolio. These opportunities include:

- Drafting a professional statement
- Conducting a security audit
- Analyzing network structure and security
- Using Linux commands to manage file permissions
- Applying filters to SQL queries
- Identifying vulnerabilities for a small business
- Documenting incidents with an incident handler’s journal 
- Importing and parsing a text file in a security-related scenario
- Creating or revising a resume

**Note:** Do not include any private, copyrighted, or proprietary documents in your portfolio. Also, if you use one of the sites described in this reading, keep your site set to “private” until it is finalized.

A **[[Professional Statement]]** is an introduction to employers that briefly describes who you are and what you care about. It allows you to showcase your interest in cybersecurity, work experience, knowledge, skills, and achievements. As you continue to learn more and refine your understanding of key cybersecurity concepts, you can return to this professional statement and revise it as needed.

## Key takeaways

Now that you’re aware of some options for creating and hosting a professional portfolio, you can consider these as you develop items for your portfolio throughout the certificate program. The more proactive you are about creating a polished portfolio, the higher your chances of impressing a potential employer and obtaining a new job opportunity in the cybersecurity profession.
