An **[[Intrusion Detection System (IDS)]]** is an application that monitors system activity and alerts on possible intrusions. The system scans and analyzes network packets, which carry small amounts of data through a network. The small amount of data makes the detection process easier for an IDS to identify potential threats to sensitive data. Other occurrences an IDS might detect can include theft and unauthorized access.


## Intrusion Detection System

An **[[intrusion detection system (IDS)]]** is an application that monitors system activity and alerts on possible intrusions. An IDS alerts administrators based on the signature of malicious traffic.

The IDS is configured to detect known attacks. IDS systems often sniff data packets as they move across the network and analyze them for the characteristics of known attacks. Some IDS systems review not only for signatures of known attacks, but also for anomalies that could be the sign of malicious activity. When the IDS discovers an anomaly, it sends an alert to the network administrator who can then investigate further.

The limitations to IDS systems are that they can only scan for known attacks or obvious anomalies. New and sophisticated attacks might not be caught. The other limitation is that the IDS doesn’t actually stop the incoming traffic if it detects something awry. It’s up to the network administrator to catch the malicious activity before it does anything damaging to the network. 

When combined with a firewall, an IDS adds another layer of defense. The IDS is placed behind the firewall and before entering the LAN, which allows the IDS to analyze data streams after network traffic that is disallowed by the firewall has been filtered out. This is done to reduce noise in IDS alerts, also referred to as false positives.

**[[Intrusion Detection System (IDS)]]:** An IDS is introduced as a system that functions similarly to home intrusion sensors. It monitors system and network activity, collecting and analyzing data for signs of abnormal activities. If unusual activities are detected, the IDS generates alerts to notify relevant personnel and channels.
