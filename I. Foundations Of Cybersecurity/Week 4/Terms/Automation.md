**[[Automation]]** is the use of technology to reduce human and manual effort in performing common and repetitive tasks. Automation also helps reduce the risk of human error.

## **Appropriate uses for automation include:**

- The automatic timing and regulation of traffic lights
- A repetitive task that is at high risk for human error
- Sending commands to a computer
- Detecting and removing duplicates of data
- Sending automated emails that are personalized by pulling individual names from a database and plugging them into the email 
- Updating a large number of file permissions
- Reporting on system data, like disk or memory usage
- Installing software
- Generating reports
- Deploying a file or a computer program to all computers on a company network
- Using a configuration management system to deploy software patches, after a human has _designed_ the system
- Populating an e-commerce site with products
- Setting the home directory and access permissions for users

## **Automation is not always an appropriate or complete solution:**

[[Automation]] cannot perform all human work. Tasks that call for human creativity, social connection, psychology, flexibility, ingenuity, evaluation, and/or complex analytic work are not good candidates for full automation. 

Sometimes automation can be used to perform one or more subtasks of a larger set of tasks – but – human intervention is required to complete the tasks. The following are some examples of tasks that cannot or should not be **fully** automated:

- Items that require human evaluation and analytic skills:
    - _Designing_ a configuration management system
    - Investigating and troubleshooting all end user problems
    - Writing a computer program
    - Building a new startup business
- Items that require human creativity and/or an eye for aesthetic qualities:
    - Designing an attractive webpage _(AI can do this, but simple automation cannot)_ 
    - Wedding photography
    - Haircuts and styling
- Items that cannot be automated due to basic physics:
    - Troubleshooting or repairing machines that cannot power on or boot up 
- Items that need human interaction, psychology, and/or evaluation skills:
    - Interviewing and hiring new employees
    - Customer service _(chat bots cannot address every customer service need)_
- Items that should not be fully automated due to costs and safety:
    - Grocery store checkout process, including bagging groceries
    - Tasks that are less expensive to perform manually

## Automating tasks in Python

**[[Automation]]** is the use of technology to reduce human and manual effort to perform common and repetitive tasks. As a security analyst, you will primarily use Python to automate tasks.

You have encountered multiple examples of how to use Python for automation in this course, including investigating logins, managing access, and updating devices.
