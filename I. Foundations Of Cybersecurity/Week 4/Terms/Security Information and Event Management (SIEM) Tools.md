**[[Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Tools]]** - A SIEM tool is an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization. SIEM tools collect real-time, or instant, information, and allow security analysts to identify potential breaches as they happen.
	Imagine having to read pages and pages of logs to determine if there are any security threats. Depending on the amount of data, it could take hours or days. SIEM tools reduce the amount of data an analyst must review by providing alerts for specific types of risks and threats.

## Commonly used SIEM tools:

- **[[Splunk]]** - is a data analysis platform, and Splunk Enterprise provides SIEM solutions. Splunk Enterprise is a self-hosted tool used to retain, analyze, and search an organization's log data.
- **[[Chronicle]]** -  is a cloud-native SIEM tool that stores security data for search and analysis. Cloud-native means that Chronicle allows for fast delivery of new features.

Both of these SIEM tools, and SIEMs in general, collect data from multiple places, then analyze and filter that data to allow security teams to prevent and quickly react to potential security threats.

A **[[logs]]** are records of events that occur within an organization’s systems. Depending on the amount of data you’re working with, it could take hours or days to filter through log data on your own.

**SIEM tools** reduce the amount of data an analyst must review by providing alerts for specific types of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.

**SIEM tools** provide a series of dashboards that visually organize data into categories, allowing users to select the data they wish to analyze. Different SIEM tools have different dashboard types that display the information you have access to. 

**SIEM tools** also come with different hosting options, including on-premise and cloud. Organizations may choose one hosting option over another based on a security team member’s expertise. For example, because a cloud-hosted version tends to be easier to set up, use, and maintain than an on-premise version, a less experienced security team may choose this option for their organization.
