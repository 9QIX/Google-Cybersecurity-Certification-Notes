- [[Linux]] - is an open-source, or publicly available, operating system. Unlike other operating systems you may be familiar with, for example MacOS or Windows, Linux relies on a command line as the primary user interface. Linux itself is not a programming language, but it does allow for the use of text-based commands between the user and the operating system.
	- A common use of Linux for entry-level security analysts is examining logs to better understand what's occurring in a system. For example, you might find yourself using commands to review an error log when investigating uncommonly high network traffic.
