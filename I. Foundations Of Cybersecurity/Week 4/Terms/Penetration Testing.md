**[[Penetration Testing]]**, also called pen testing, is the act of participating in a simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes. It is a thorough risk assessment that can evaluate and identify external and internal threats as well as weaknesses.

## **Penetration Testing:**

An essential aspect of security hardening is conducting regular **[[penetration testing]]** (pen testing). Penetration tests simulate cyberattacks to identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes. Penetration testers document their findings in detailed reports, which help security teams pinpoint specific vulnerabilities that need attention. Organizations can then devise plans to remediate these vulnerabilities, enhancing overall security.
