[[Encryption]] makes data unreadable and difficult to decode for an unauthorized user; its main goal is to ensure confidentiality of private data. **Encryption** is the process of converting data from a readable format to a cryptographically encoded format. 

**[[Encryption]]** - is the process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format. Typically, encryption involves converting data from plaintext to ciphertext. 

**[[Encryption]]**: VPNs encrypt your data as it travels over the internet, ensuring the confidentiality of your information.

**[[Encryption]]** is the process of scrambling information into ciphertext, which is not readable to anyone without the encryption key. Encryption primarily originated from manually encoding messages and information using an algorithm to convert any given letter or number to a new value. Modern encryption relies on the secrecy of a key, rather than the secrecy of an algorithm. Cryptography is an important tool that helps secure cloud networks and data at rest to prevent unauthorized access. Youâ€™ll learn more about cryptography in-depth in an upcoming course.
