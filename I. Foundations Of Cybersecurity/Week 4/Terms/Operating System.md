An **[[Operating System]]** is the interface between computer hardware and the user. Linux®, macOS®, and Windows are operating systems. They each offer different functionality and user experiences.

The **[[operating system]]** receives the user’s request from the application. It’s the operating system’s job to interpret the request and direct its flow. In order to complete the task, the operating system sends it on to applicable components of the hardware.
