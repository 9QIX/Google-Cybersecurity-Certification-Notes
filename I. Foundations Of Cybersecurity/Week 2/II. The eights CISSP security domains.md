As of 2022, CISSP has defined eight domains to organize the work of security professionals. CISSP defines eight domains in total. 

# Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) Security Domains:

- #### [[Security and Risk Management]]
	- Security and risk management focuses on defining *security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and the law*.  
	- For example, security analysts may need to update company policies related to private health information if a change is made to a federal compliance regulation such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, also known as HIPAA.
	
- #### [[Asset Security]]
	- This domain focuses on *securing digital and physical assets*. It's also related to the *storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data*. 
	- When working with this domain, security analysts may be tasked with making sure that old equipment is properly disposed of and destroyed, including any type of confidential information.
	
- #### [[Security Architecture and Engineering]]
	- This domain focuses on optimizing data security by ensuring effective *tools, systems, and processes are in place*. 
	- As a security analyst, you may be tasked with configuring a firewall. 
	- A [[Firewall]] is a device used to monitor and filter incoming and outgoing computer network traffic. Setting up a firewall correctly helps prevent attacks that could affect productivity.
	
- #### [[Communication and Network Security]]
	- This domain focuses on *managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications*. 
	- As a security analyst, you may be asked to analyze user behavior within your organization.

- #### [[Identity and Access Management]]
	- Identity and access management focuses on *keeping data secure, by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets, such as networks and applications*. 
	- Validating the identities of employees and documenting access roles are essential to maintaining the organization's physical and digital security. For example, as a security analyst, you may be tasked with setting up employees' keycard access to buildings.
	-  For example, as a security analyst, you may be tasked with setting up employees' keycard access to buildings. 

- #### [[Security Assessment and Testing]]
	- This domain focuses on *conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities*. 
	- Security analysts may conduct regular audits of user permissions, to make sure that users have the correct level of access. 
	- For example, access to payroll information is often limited to certain employees, so analysts may be asked to regularly audit permissions to ensure that no unauthorized person can view employee salaries. 

- #### [[Security Operations]]
	- This domain focuses on *conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.* 
	- Imagine that you, as a security analyst, receive an alert that an unknown device has been connected to your internal network. You would need to follow the organization's policies and procedures to quickly stop the potential threat.

- #### [[Software Development Security]]
	- This domain focuses on using *secure coding practices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services*. 
	- A security analyst may work with software development teams to ensure security practices are incorporated into the software development life-cycle. 
	- If, for example, one of your partner teams is creating a new mobile app, then you may be asked to advise on the password policies or ensure that any user data is properly secured and managed.

![[fJ0g68UxToW3OSJob2ecKg_30973561259c420c8fe8ae7697cf10f1_CS_R-021_Security-domains.png]]

## **[[Password Attack]]** 
##### [[Communication and Network Security]]

A **password attack** is an attempt to access password-secured devices, systems, networks, or data. Some forms of password attacks that you’ll learn about later in the certificate program are:  

- [[Brute Force]] - A method of attempting every possible combination or password until the correct one is found.
- [[Rainbow Table]] - A precomputed table used to quickly reverse cryptographic hash functions and recover original passwords.

Password attacks fall under the [[communication and network security]] domain. 

### **[[Social Engineering Attack]]**

##### [[Security and Risk Management]]

**Social engineering** is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Some forms of social engineering attacks that you will continue to learn about throughout the program are:

- [[Phishing]] - A deceptive cyberattack where attackers impersonate trusted entities via email, aiming to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information or performing malicious actions.
- [[Smishing]] - A variant of phishing that involves sending fraudulent SMS or text messages to manipulate recipients into divulging personal information or clicking on malicious links.
- [[Vishing]] - Voice phishing, a type of attack using phone calls to deceive individuals into sharing confidential data or executing unauthorized transactions.
- [[Spear Phishing]] - A targeted phishing attack that tailors deceptive messages to specific individuals or groups, often leveraging personalized information.
- [[Whaling]] - A specialized form of spear phishing that targets high-profile individuals or executives within organizations.
- [[Social Media Phishing]] - Exploiting social media platforms to gather information and execute phishing attacks based on users' online behavior and connections.
- [[Business Email Compromise]] (BEC) - A sophisticated attack where cybercriminals compromise or impersonate legitimate business emails to manipulate employees into transferring funds or sensitive data.
- [[Watering Hole Attack]] - A cyber assault where attackers compromise a website frequented by their intended victims to infect them with malware.
- [[USB baiting]] (Universal Serial Bus) - Distributing booby-trapped USB devices in hopes that someone will plug them in, allowing malware to spread.
- [[Physical social engineering]] - Manipulating individuals in person to gather confidential information, bypass security controls, or gain unauthorized access.

Social engineering attacks are related to the [[security and risk management]]domain.

### **[[Physical Attack]]**

##### [[Asset Security]]

A **physical attack** is a security incident that affects not only digital but also physical environments where the incident is deployed. Some forms of physical attacks are:

- [[Malicious USB Cable]] - A manipulated or compromised Universal Serial Bus (USB) cable designed to deliver malware or unauthorized actions when connected to a computer or device.
- [[Malicious Flash Drive]] - A USB storage device intentionally loaded with malware or harmful code, intended to infect or compromise systems upon insertion.
- [[Card Cloning and Skimming]] - Illicit techniques involving copying card data from legitimate payment cards (cloning) or capturing card information from point-of-sale devices (skimming) to commit financial fraud.
    
Physical attacks fall under the [[asset security]] domain.

### **[[Adversarial Artificial Intelligence]]**

##### [[Identity and Access Management]]
##### [[Communication and Network Security]]

**Adversarial artificial intelligence** is a technique that manipulates [artificial intelligence and machine learning](https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/ai/adversarial-machine-learning) technology to conduct attacks more efficiently. Adversarial artificial intelligence falls under both the [[communication and network security]] and the [[identity and access management]] domains.

### **[[Supply-Chain Attack]]**

##### [[Security and Risk Management]]
##### [[Security Operations]]

A **supply-chain attack** targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed. Because every item sold undergoes a process that involves third parties, this means that the security breach can occur at any point in the supply chain. These attacks are costly because they can affect multiple organizations and the individuals who work for them. Supply-chain attacks can fall under several domains, including but not limited to the [[security and risk management]], [[security architecture and engineering]], and [[security operations]] domains.

### **[[Cryptographic Attack]]**

##### [[Communication and Network Security]]

A **cryptographic attack** affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient. Some forms of cryptographic attacks are: 

- [[Birthday]] - An attack that exploits the probability of two different inputs producing the same cryptographic hash value, potentially compromising security.
- [[Collision]] - A type of cryptographic attack that seeks to find two distinct inputs that produce the same hash value, undermining the integrity of hash functions.
- [[Downgrade]] - A tactic where an attacker forces a system or communication to use a weaker security protocol, making it susceptible to exploitation.
    
Cryptographic attacks fall under the [[communication and network security ]]domain. 

#### Key takeaways

The eight CISSP security domains can help an organization and its security team fortify against and prepare for a data breach. Data breaches range from simple to complex and fall under one or more domains. Note that the methods of attack discussed are only a few of many. These and other types of attacks will be discussed throughout the certificate program.

# Understand attackers

Previously, you were introduced to the concept of threat actors. As a reminder, a **[[threat actor]]** is any person or group who presents a security risk. In this reading, you’ll learn about different types of threat actors. You will also learn about their motivations, intentions, and how they’ve influenced the security industry.

## [[Threat Actor Types]]

### **[[Advanced Persistent Threats]]**

Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have significant expertise accessing an organization's network without authorization. APTs tend to research their targets (e.g., large corporations or government entities)  in advance and can remain undetected for an extended period of time. Their intentions and motivations can include:

- Damaging critical infrastructure, such as the power grid and natural resources
- Gaining access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets or patents

### **[[Insider threats]]**

Insider threats abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization. Their intentions and motivations can include: 

- Sabotage
- Corruption
- Espionage
- Unauthorized data access or leaks

### **[[Hacktivists]]**

Hacktivists are threat actors that are driven by a political agenda. They abuse digital technology to accomplish their goals, which may include: 

- Demonstrations
- Propaganda
- Social change campaigns
- Fame

## [[Hacker Types]]

![Six pirates informatiques sur des ordinateurs.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/OHc71ylUQoWnWRkgeKXEgw_2c16d4ed0420478c938c9af9257ccff1_image1.png?expiry=1692489600000&hmac=e_osntjfmY2ImKA4mAQasHMr3sgzZT3S4xpHUAxEzCU)

A **[[Hacker]]** is any person who uses computers to gain access to computer systems, networks, or data. They can be beginner or advanced technology professionals who use their skills for a variety of reasons. There are three main categories of hackers:

- Authorized hackers are also called [[Ethical Hackers]]. They follow a code of ethics and adhere to the law to conduct organizational risk evaluations. They are motivated to safeguard people and organizations from malicious threat actors.
- Semi-authorized hackers are considered [[Researchers]]. They search for vulnerabilities but don’t take advantage of the vulnerabilities they find.
- Unauthorized hackers are also called [[Unethical Hackers]]. They are malicious threat actors who do not follow or respect the law. Their goal is to collect and sell confidential data for financial gain. 

**Note:** There are multiple hacker types that fall into one or more of these three categories.

New and unskilled threat actors have various goals, including: 

- To learn and enhance their hacking skills
- To seek revenge
- To exploit security weaknesses by using existing malware, programming scripts, and other tactics 

Other types of hackers are not motivated by any particular agenda other than completing the job they were contracted to do. These types of hackers can be considered **unethical or ethical hackers**. They have been known to work on both illegal and legal tasks for pay.

There are also hackers who consider themselves vigilantes. Their main goal is to protect the world from unethical hackers.

## Key takeaways

[[Threat actor]] and [[Hacker]] are technically skilled individuals. Understanding their motivations and intentions will help you be better prepared to protect your organization and the people it serves from malicious attacks carried out by some of these individuals and groups.
