**[[Social Engineering]]** is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Human error is usually a result of trusting someone without question. It’s the mission of a threat actor, acting as a social engineer, to create an environment of false trust and lies to exploit as many people as possible. 

Some of the most common types of social engineering attacks today include:

- **[[Social media phishing]]:** A threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites. Then, they initiate an attack.
    
- **[[Watering hole attack]]:** A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.
    
- **[[USB baiting]]:** A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network. 
    
- **[[Physical social engineering]]:** A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.

[[Social Engineering]] is incredibly effective. This is because people are generally trusting and conditioned to respect authority. The number of social engineering attacks is increasing with every new social media application that allows public access to people's data. Although sharing personal data—such as your location or photos—can be convenient, it’s also a risk.
