- #### [[Security and Risk Management]]
	- Security and risk management focuses on defining *security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and the law*.  
	- For example, security analysts may need to update company policies related to private health information if a change is made to a federal compliance regulation such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, also known as HIPAA.

# Attacks that Occur in Security and Risk Management
### **[[Social Engineering Attack]]**

**Social engineering** is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Some forms of social engineering attacks that you will continue to learn about throughout the program are:

- [[Phishing]] - A deceptive cyberattack where attackers impersonate trusted entities via email, aiming to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information or performing malicious actions.
- [[Smishing]] - A variant of phishing that involves sending fraudulent SMS or text messages to manipulate recipients into divulging personal information or clicking on malicious links.
- [[Vishing]] - Voice phishing, a type of attack using phone calls to deceive individuals into sharing confidential data or executing unauthorized transactions.
- [[Spear Phishing]] - A targeted phishing attack that tailors deceptive messages to specific individuals or groups, often leveraging personalized information.
- [[Whaling]] - A specialized form of spear phishing that targets high-profile individuals or executives within organizations.
- [[Social Media Phishing]] - Exploiting social media platforms to gather information and execute phishing attacks based on users' online behavior and connections.
- [[Business Email Compromise]] (BEC) - A sophisticated attack where cybercriminals compromise or impersonate legitimate business emails to manipulate employees into transferring funds or sensitive data.
- [[Watering Hole Attack]] - A cyber assault where attackers compromise a website frequented by their intended victims to infect them with malware.
- [[USB baiting]] (Universal Serial Bus) - Distributing booby-trapped USB devices in hopes that someone will plug them in, allowing malware to spread.
- [[Physical social engineering]] - Manipulating individuals in person to gather confidential information, bypass security controls, or gain unauthorized access.

Social engineering attacks are related to the [[security and risk management]]domain.

### **[[Supply-Chain Attack]]**

A **supply-chain attack** targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed. Because every item sold undergoes a process that involves third parties, this means that the security breach can occur at any point in the supply chain. These attacks are costly because they can affect multiple organizations and the individuals who work for them. Supply-chain attacks can fall under several domains, including but not limited to the [[security and risk management]], [[security architecture and engineering]], and [[security operations]] domains.

# Domain one: [[Security and risk management]]

All organizations must develop their security posture. Security posture is an organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. Elements of the security and risk management domain that impact an organization's security posture include:

- Security goals and objectives
- Risk mitigation processes
- Compliance
- Business continuity plans
- Legal regulations
- Professional and organizational ethics

[[Information security]], or InfoSec, is also related to this domain and refers to a set of processes established to secure information. An organization may use playbooks and implement training as a part of their security and risk management program, based on their needs and perceived risk. There are many InfoSec design processes, such as:

- Incident response
- Vulnerability management
- Application security
- Cloud security
- Infrastructure security

As an example, a security team may need to alter how personally identifiable information (PII) is treated in order to adhere to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
