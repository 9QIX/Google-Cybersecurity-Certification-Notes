**[[Ransomware]]:** A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access. 

- **[[Ransomware]]** is a malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data then demand payment to restore access. 
	- Once ransomware is deployed by an attacker, it can freeze network systems, leave devices unusable, and encrypt, or lock confidential data, making devices inaccessible. The [[threat actor]] then demands a ransom before providing a decryption key to allow organizations to return to their normal business operations. Think of a decryption key as a password provided to regain access to your data. Note that when ransom negotiations occur or data is leaked by threat actors, these events can occur through the dark web.

**[[Ransomware]]:** Ransomware is a type of malicious attack where attackers encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access. It's known to victims, and decryption is offered upon payment, although there's no guarantee of non-recurrence.
