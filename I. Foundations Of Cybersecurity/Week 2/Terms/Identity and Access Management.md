- #### [[Identity and Access Management]]
	- Identity and access management focuses on *keeping data secure, by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets, such as networks and applications*. 
	- Validating the identities of employees and documenting access roles are essential to maintaining the organization's physical and digital security. For example, as a security analyst, you may be tasked with setting up employees' keycard access to buildings.

# Attacks That May Occur in Identity and Access Management
### **[[Adversarial Artificial Intelligence]]**

**Adversarial artificial intelligence** is a technique that manipulates [artificial intelligence and machine learning](https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/ai/adversarial-machine-learning) technology to conduct attacks more efficiently. Adversarial artificial intelligence falls under both the communication and [[network security]] and the [[identity and access management]] domains.


## Domain five: [[Identity and access management]]

The identity and access management (IAM) domain focuses on keeping data secure. It does this by ensuring user identities are trusted and authenticated and that access to physical and logical assets is authorized. This helps prevent unauthorized users, while allowing authorized users to perform their tasks.

Essentially, IAM uses what is referred to as the principle of least privilege, which is the concept of granting only the minimal access and authorization required to complete a task. 

As an example, a cybersecurity analyst might be asked to ensure that customer service representatives can only view the private data of a customer, such as their phone number, while working to resolve the customer's issue; then remove access when the customer's issue is resolved.
