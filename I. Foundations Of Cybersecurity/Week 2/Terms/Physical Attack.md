### **[[Physical Attack]]**

A **physical attack** is a security incident that affects not only digital but also physical environments where the incident is deployed. Some forms of physical attacks are:

- [[Malicious USB Cable]] - A manipulated or compromised Universal Serial Bus (USB) cable designed to deliver malware or unauthorized actions when connected to a computer or device.
- [[Malicious Flash Drive]] - A USB storage device intentionally loaded with malware or harmful code, intended to infect or compromise systems upon insertion.
- [[Card Cloning and Skimming]] - Illicit techniques involving copying card data from legitimate payment cards (cloning) or capturing card information from point-of-sale devices (skimming) to commit financial fraud.
    
Physical attacks fall under the [[asset security]] domain.
