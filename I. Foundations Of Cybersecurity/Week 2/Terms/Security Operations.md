- #### [[Security Operations]]
	- This domain focuses on *conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.* 
	- Imagine that you, as a security analyst, receive an alert that an unknown device has been connected to your internal network. You would need to follow the organization's policies and procedures to quickly stop the potential threat

# Attacks That May Occur in Security Operations
### **[[Supply-Chain Attack]]**

A **supply-chain attack** targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed. Because every item sold undergoes a process that involves third parties, this means that the security breach can occur at any point in the supply chain. These attacks are costly because they can affect multiple organizations and the individuals who work for them. Supply-chain attacks can fall under several domains, including but not limited to the [[security and risk management]], [[security architecture and engineering]], and [[security operations]] domains.

## Domain seven: [[Security operations]] 

The security operations domain focuses on the investigation of a potential data breach and the implementation of preventative measures after a security incident has occurred. This includes using strategies, processes, and tools such as:

- Training and awareness
- Reporting and documentation
- Intrusion detection and prevention
- SIEM tools   
- Log management
- Incident management
- Playbooks
- Post-breach forensics
- Reflecting on lessons learned

The cybersecurity professionals involved in this domain work as a team to manage, prevent, and investigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. These individuals are trained to handle active attacks, such as large amounts of data being accessed from an organization's internal network, outside of normal working hours. Once a threat is identified, the team works diligently to keep private data and information safe from threat actors.
