- #### [[Asset Security]]
	- This domain focuses on *securing digital and physical assets*. It's also related to the *storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data*. 
	- When working with this domain, security analysts may be tasked with making sure that old equipment is properly disposed of and destroyed, including any type of confidential information.

# Attacks That May Occur in Asset Security 
### **[[Physical Attack]]**

A **physical attack** is a security incident that affects not only digital but also physical environments where the incident is deployed. Some forms of physical attacks are:

- [[Malicious USB Cable]] - A manipulated or compromised Universal Serial Bus (USB) cable designed to deliver malware or unauthorized actions when connected to a computer or device.
- [[Malicious Flash Drive]] - A USB storage device intentionally loaded with malware or harmful code, intended to infect or compromise systems upon insertion.
- [[Card Cloning and Skimming]] - Illicit techniques involving copying card data from legitimate payment cards (cloning) or capturing card information from point-of-sale devices (skimming) to commit financial fraud.
    
Physical attacks fall under the [[asset security]] domain.

## Domain two: [[Asset security]]

Asset security involves managing the cybersecurity processes of organizational assets, including the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of physical and virtual data. 

Because the loss or theft of assets can expose an organization and increase the level of risk, keeping track of assets and the data they hold is essential. Conducting a security impact analysis, establishing a recovery plan, and managing data exposure will depend on the level of risk associated with each asset. Security analysts may need to store, maintain, and retain data by creating backups to ensure they are able to restore the environment if a security incident places the organization’s data at risk.
