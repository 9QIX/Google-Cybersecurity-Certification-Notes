### **[[Cryptographic Attack]]**

A **cryptographic attack** affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient. Some forms of cryptographic attacks are: 

- [[Birthday]] - An attack that exploits the probability of two different inputs producing the same cryptographic hash value, potentially compromising security.
- [[Collision]] - A type of cryptographic attack that seeks to find two distinct inputs that produce the same hash value, undermining the integrity of hash functions.
- [[Downgrade]] - A tactic where an attacker forces a system or communication to use a weaker security protocol, making it susceptible to exploitation.
    
Cryptographic attacks fall under the communication and network security domain.
