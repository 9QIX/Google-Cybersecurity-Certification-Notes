**[[Virus]]:** refer to “computer virus”

## Virus

A **[[virus]]** is malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. This type of malware must be installed by the target user before it can spread itself and cause damage. One of the many ways that viruses are spread is through phishing campaigns where malicious links are hidden within links or attachments.
