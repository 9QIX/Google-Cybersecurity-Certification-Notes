- #### [[Security Architecture and Engineering]]
	- This domain focuses on optimizing data security by ensuring effective *tools, systems, and processes are in place*. 
	- As a security analyst, you may be tasked with configuring a firewall. 
	- A [[Firewall]] is a device used to monitor and filter incoming and outgoing computer network traffic. Setting up a firewall correctly helps prevent attacks that could affect productivity

# Attacks That May Occur in Security Architecture and Engineering
### **[[Supply-Chain Attack]]**

A **supply-chain attack** targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed. Because every item sold undergoes a process that involves third parties, this means that the security breach can occur at any point in the supply chain. These attacks are costly because they can affect multiple organizations and the individuals who work for them. Supply-chain attacks can fall under several domains, including but not limited to the [[security and risk management]], [[security architecture and engineering]], and [[security operations]] domains.

## Domain three: [[Security architecture and engineering]]

This domain focuses on managing data security. Ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place helps protect an organizationâ€™s assets and data. Security architects and engineers create these processes.

One important aspect of this domain is the concept of shared responsibility. Shared responsibility means all individuals involved take an active role in lowering risk during the design of a security system. Additional design principles related to this domain, which are discussed later in the program, include:

- Threat modeling
- Least privilege
- Defense in depth
- Fail securely
- Separation of duties
- Keep it simple
- Zero trust
- Trust but verify

An example of managing data is the use of a [[security information and event management (SIEM)]] tool to monitor for flags related to unusual login or user activity that could indicate a [[threat actor]] is attempting to access private data.
