In the year 2000, Onel De Guzman created the [[Love Letter]] malware to steal internet login credentials. This attack spread rapidly and took advantage of people who had not developed a healthy suspicion for unsolicited emails. Users received an email with the subject line, "I Love You." Each email contained an attachment labeled, "Love Letter For You. "When the attachment was opened, the malware scanned a user's address book. Then, it automatically sent itself to each person on the list and installed a program to collect user information and passwords. Recipients would think they were receiving an email from a friend, but it was actually malware. The Love Letter ended up infecting 45 million computers globally and is believed to have caused over $10 billion dollars in damages. The Love Letter attack is the first example of social engineering.
