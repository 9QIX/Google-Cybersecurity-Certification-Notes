### **[[Advanced Persistent Threats]]**

Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have significant expertise accessing an organization's network without authorization. APTs tend to research their targets (e.g., large corporations or government entities)Â  in advance and can remain undetected for an extended period of time. Their intentions and motivations can include:

- Damaging critical infrastructure, such as the power grid and natural resources
- Gaining access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets or patents
