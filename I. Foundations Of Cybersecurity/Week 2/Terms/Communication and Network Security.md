- #### [[Communication and Network Security]]
	- This domain focuses on *managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications*. 
	- As a security analyst, you may be asked to analyze user behavior within your organization.
	- Secure networks keep an organization's data and communications safe whether on-site, or in the cloud, or when connecting to services remotely. 
	- For example, employees working remotely in public spaces need to be protected from vulnerabilities that can occur when they use insecure bluetooth connections or public wifi hotspots. By having security team members remove access to those types of communication channels at the organizational level, employees may be discouraged from practicing insecure behavior that could be exploited by threat actors. 

# Attacks that May Occur in Communication and Network Security
## **[[Password Attack]]**

A **password attack** is an attempt to access password-secured devices, systems, networks, or data. Some forms of password attacks that you’ll learn about later in the certificate program are:  

- [[Brute Force]] - A method of attempting every possible combination or password until the correct one is found.
- [[Rainbow Table]] - A precomputed table used to quickly reverse cryptographic hash functions and recover original passwords.

Password attacks fall under the [[communication and network security]] domain. 

### **[[Cryptographic Attack]]**

A **cryptographic attack** affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient. Some forms of cryptographic attacks are: 

- [[Birthday]] - An attack that exploits the probability of two different inputs producing the same cryptographic hash value, potentially compromising security.
- [[Collision]] - A type of cryptographic attack that seeks to find two distinct inputs that produce the same hash value, undermining the integrity of hash functions.
- [[Downgrade]] - A tactic where an attacker forces a system or communication to use a weaker security protocol, making it susceptible to exploitation.
    
Cryptographic attacks fall under the [[communication and network security ]]domain.

### **[[Adversarial Artificial Intelligence]]**

**Adversarial artificial intelligence** is a technique that manipulates [artificial intelligence and machine learning](https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/ai/adversarial-machine-learning) technology to conduct attacks more efficiently. Adversarial artificial intelligence falls under both the communication and [[network security]] and the [[identity and access management]] domains.


## Domain four: [[Communication and network security]]

This domain focuses on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications. This includes on-site, remote, and cloud communications. 

Organizations with remote, hybrid, and on-site work environments must ensure data remains secure, but managing external connections to make certain that remote workers are securely accessing an organization’s networks is a challenge. Designing network security controls—such as restricted network access—can help protect users and ensure an organization’s network remains secure when employees travel or work outside of the main office.
