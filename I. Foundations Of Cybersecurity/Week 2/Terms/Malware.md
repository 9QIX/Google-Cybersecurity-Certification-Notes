[[Malware]], which is software designed to harm devices or networks. Two examples of early malware attacks that we'll cover are the Brain virus and the Morris worm. 

**[[Malware]]** is software designed to harm devices or networks. There are many types of malware. The primary purpose of malware is to obtain money, or in some cases, an intelligence advantage that can be used against a person, an organization, or a territory.  

- **[[Viruses]]:** Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. A virus needs to be initiated by a user (i.e., a threat actor), who transmits the virus via a malicious attachment or file download. When someone opens the malicious attachment or download, the virus hides itself in other files in the now infected system. When the infected files are opened, it allows the virus to insert its own code to damage and/or destroy data in the system.
- **[[Worms]]:** Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own. In contrast to a virus, a worm does not need to be downloaded by a user. Instead, it self-replicates and spreads from an already infected computer to other devices on the same network.
- **[[Ransomware]]:** A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access. 
- **[[Spyware]]:** Malware that’s used to gather and sell information without consent. Spyware can be used to access devices. This allows threat actors to collect personal data, such as private emails, texts, voice and image recordings, and locations.

# Malicious software

Both humans and computers share a vulnerability to infection, though in different forms. Just as humans can get infected by viruses causing illnesses, computers can be infected by malware (malicious software) designed to harm devices or networks. **[[Malware]]** can spread through various means, including infected USB drives and online transmissions, and devices connected to the internet are especially susceptible.
