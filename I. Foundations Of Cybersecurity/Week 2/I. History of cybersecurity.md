# Past cybersecurity attacks

#### [[Computer Virus]]
Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. The virus attaches itself to programs or documents on a computer, then spreads and infects one or more computers in a network. 
Today, viruses are more commonly referred to as [[Malware]], which is software designed to harm devices or networks. Two examples of early malware attacks that we'll cover are the **[[Brain virus]] and the [[Morris worm]]**. 

In **1986**, the **Alvi brothers** created the [[Brain virus]], although the intention of the virus was to track illegal copies of medical software and prevent pirated licenses, what the virus actually did was unexpected. Once a person used a pirated copy of the software ,the virus-infected that computer. Then, any disk that was inserted into the computer was also infected. The virus spread to a new computer every time someone used one of the infected disks. Undetected, the virus spread globally within a couple of months. Although the intention was not to destroy data or hardware, the virus slowed down productivity and significantly impacted business operations. 

In 1988, Robert Morris developed program to assess the size of the internet. The program crawled the web and installed itself onto other computers to tally the number of computers that were connected to the internet. The program, however, failed to keep track of the computers it had already compromised and continued to re-install itself until the computers ran out of memory and crashed. About 6,000 computers were affected, representing 10% of the internet at the time. This attack cost millions of dollars in damages due to business disruptions and the efforts required to remove the worm. After the [[Morris worm]], Computer Emergency Response Teams, known as CERTs®, were established to respond to computer security incidents. CERTs still exist today, but their place in the security industry has expanded to include more responsibilities. 

# Attacks in the digital age

### [[Love Letter]]
In the year 2000, Onel De Guzman created the [[Love Letter]] malware to steal internet login credentials. This attack spread rapidly and took advantage of people who had not developed a healthy suspicion for unsolicited emails. Users received an email with the subject line, "I Love You." Each email contained an attachment labeled, "Love Letter For You. "When the attachment was opened, the malware scanned a user's address book. Then, it automatically sent itself to each person on the list and installed a program to collect user information and passwords. Recipients would think they were receiving an email from a friend, but it was actually malware. The Love Letter ended up infecting **45 million computers globally and is believed to have caused over $10 billion dollars in damages**. The Love Letter attack is the first example of [[Social Engineering]]. 

### [[Methods of Attacks]]
- [[Social Engineering]] is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.
- [[Phishing]] is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software.

### [[Equifax]]
In 2017, attackers successfully infiltrated the credit reporting agency, [[Equifax]].
This resulted in one of the largest known data breaches of sensitive information.
Over 143 million customer records were stolen, and the breach affected approximately 40% of all Americans. The records included personally identifiable information including social security numbers, birth dates, driver's license numbers, home addresses, and credit card numbers.

# Common attacks and their effectiveness

## [[Phishing]]

**[[Phishing]]** is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. 

Some of the most common types of phishing attacks today include: 

- **[[Business Email Compromise]] (BEC):** A threat actor sends an email message that seems to be from a known source to make a seemingly legitimate request for information, in order to obtain a financial advantage.
    
- **[[Spear phishing]]:** A malicious email attack that targets a specific user or group of users. The email seems to originate from a trusted source.
    
- **[[Whaling]]:** A form of spear phishing. Threat actors target company executives to gain access to sensitive data.
    
- **[[Vishing]]:** The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.
    
- **[[Smishing]]:** The use of text messages to trick users, in order to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.
    

## [[Malware]]

**[[Malware]]** is software designed to harm devices or networks. There are many types of malware. The primary purpose of malware is to obtain money, or in some cases, an intelligence advantage that can be used against a person, an organization, or a territory.  

Some of the most common types of malware attacks today include: 

- **[[Viruses]]:** Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. A virus needs to be initiated by a user (i.e., a threat actor), who transmits the virus via a malicious attachment or file download. When someone opens the malicious attachment or download, the virus hides itself in other files in the now infected system. When the infected files are opened, it allows the virus to insert its own code to damage and/or destroy data in the system.
    
- **[[Worms]]:** Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own. In contrast to a virus, a worm does not need to be downloaded by a user. Instead, it self-replicates and spreads from an already infected computer to other devices on the same network.
    
- **[[Ransomware]]:** A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access. 
    
- **[[Spyware]]:** Malware that’s used to gather and sell information without consent. Spyware can be used to access devices. This allows threat actors to collect personal data, such as private emails, texts, voice and image recordings, and locations.
    

## [[Social Engineering]] 

**[[Social Engineering]]** is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Human error is usually a result of trusting someone without question. It’s the mission of a threat actor, acting as a social engineer, to create an environment of false trust and lies to exploit as many people as possible. 

Some of the most common types of social engineering attacks today include:

- **[[Social media phishing]]:** A threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites. Then, they initiate an attack.
    
- **[[Watering hole attack]]:** A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.
    
- **[[USB baiting]]:** A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network. 
    
- **[[Physical social engineering]]:** A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.
    

### **Social engineering principles** 

[[Social Engineering]] is incredibly effective. This is because people are generally trusting and conditioned to respect authority. The number of social engineering attacks is increasing with every new social media application that allows public access to people's data. Although sharing personal data—such as your location or photos—can be convenient, it’s also a risk.

Reasons why social engineering attacks are effective include:

- **Authority:** Threat actors impersonate individuals with power. This is because people, in general, have been conditioned to respect and follow authority figures. 
    
- **Intimidation:** Threat actors use bullying tactics. This includes persuading and intimidating victims into doing what they’re told. 
    
- **Consensus/Social proof:** Because people sometimes do things that they believe many others are doing, threat actors use others’ trust to pretend they are legitimate. For example, a threat actor might try to gain access to private data by telling an employee that other people at the company have given them access to that data in the past. 
    
- **Scarcity:** A tactic used to imply that goods or services are in limited supply. 
    
- **Familiarity:** Threat actors establish a fake emotional connection with users that can be exploited.  
    
- **Trust:** Threat actors establish an emotional relationship with users that can be exploited _over time_. They use this relationship to develop trust and gain personal information.
    
- **Urgency:** A threat actor persuades others to respond quickly and without questioning.
    

### Key takeaways

In this reading, you learned about some common attacks and their impacts. You also learned about social engineering and why it’s so successful. While this is only a brief introduction to attack types, you will have many opportunities throughout the program to further develop your understanding of how to identify and defend against cybersecurity attacks.

## Keep your cool during a data breach

The first thing you're going to do is to *contain the breach*. If you are still hemorrhaging data, you go through your progressions to stop hemorrhaging data. So if that means *shutting down a server, shutting down a data center, shutting down comms, whatever, stopping the data loss is that is your number one priority*. Your job as an incident manager or as somebody working a breach is to stop the breach and then investigate the breach. So executing your incident management by plan is the most important thing that an entry level person can keep in mind.
