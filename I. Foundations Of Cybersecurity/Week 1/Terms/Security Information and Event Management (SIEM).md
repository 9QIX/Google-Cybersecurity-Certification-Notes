[[Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)]] tools: SIEM tools collect and analyze log data, or records of events such as unusual login behavior, and support analysts’ ability to monitor critical activities in an organization. This helps cybersecurity professionals identify and analyze potential security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities more efficiently.

When security analysts need to review vulnerabilities, they conduct a **periodic security audit.** This is a review of an organization’s records, activities, and related documents. During audits, [[Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)]] (SIEM) tools** help analysts better understand security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.

- **SIEM Overview:** SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management. It is a tool that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities within an organization's network. The analogy of a car dashboard is used to explain how SIEM tools provide a high-level overview of network activities, similar to how a car dashboard gives a driver information about the car's components.
- **SIEM Process:** 
	- SIEM **tools collect and aggregate data** from various sources, such as IDS/IPS, databases, firewalls, and applications. 
		- **SIEM Data Collection:** SIEM tools can collect a huge volume of raw data from multiple sources, which may not all be relevant for security analysis. Data normalization helps clean up and make data consistent for analysis.
	- This **data is then normalized** to remove non-essential attributes and create consistency in log records. 
	- After normalization, the **data is analyzed** against configured rules to detect security incidents, which are categorized and reported as alerts for security analysts to review.

- **SIEM Overview:** **[[Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)]]**. It is an application used to collect, analyze, and report on log data from various sources within an organization. SIEM tools play a critical role in monitoring and managing security-related activities.
- **SIEM Data Collection Process:** SIEM tools go through a systematic data collection process that involves the following steps:
	1. **[[Data Collection and Processing]]:** SIEM tools collect and process vast amounts of data generated by devices and systems throughout an environment. This data comes in different formats.
	2. **[[Normalization]]:** SIEM tools normalize the data, ensuring that it is consistently formatted and includes only relevant event information. Normalization simplifies data analysis.
	3. **[[Indexing]]:** The normalized data is indexed, making it easily accessible through search. This indexing allows security analysts to quickly access and analyze events from various sources.
