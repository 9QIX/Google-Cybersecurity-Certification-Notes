[[Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)]] tools: SIEM tools collect and analyze log data, or records of events such as unusual login behavior, and support analysts’ ability to monitor critical activities in an organization. This helps cybersecurity professionals identify and analyze potential security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities more efficiently.

When security analysts need to review vulnerabilities, they conduct a **periodic security audit.** This is a review of an organization’s records, activities, and related documents. During audits, [[Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)]] (SIEM) tools** help analysts better understand security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.

- **SIEM Overview:** SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management. It is a tool that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities within an organization's network. The analogy of a car dashboard is used to explain how SIEM tools provide a high-level overview of network activities, similar to how a car dashboard gives a driver information about the car's components.
- **SIEM Process:** 
	- SIEM **tools collect and aggregate data** from various sources, such as IDS/IPS, databases, firewalls, and applications. 
	- This **data is then normalized** to remove non-essential attributes and create consistency in log records. 
	- After normalization, the **data is analyzed** against configured rules to detect security incidents, which are categorized and reported as alerts for security analysts to review.
- **SIEM Data Collection:** SIEM tools can collect a huge volume of raw data from multiple sources, which may not all be relevant for security analysis. Data normalization helps clean up and make data consistent for analysis.
