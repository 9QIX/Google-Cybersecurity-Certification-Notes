[[Security Frameworks]] are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy. Security frameworks provide a structured approach to implementing a security lifecycle. The security lifecycle is a constantly evolving set of policies and standards that define how an organization manages risks, follows established guidelines, and meets regulatory compliance, or laws.

**[[Security frameworks]]** are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy. They have four core components:

1. [[Identifying and Documenting Security Goals]]
2. [[Setting Guidelines to Achieve Security Goals]]Â 
3. [[Implementing Strong Security Processes]]
4. [[Monitoring and Communicating Results]]

**[[Compliance]]** is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations.
