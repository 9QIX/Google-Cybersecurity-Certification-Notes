[[Security Frameworks]] are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy. Security frameworks provide a structured approach to implementing a security lifecycle. The security lifecycle is a constantly evolving set of policies and standards that define how an organization manages risks, follows established guidelines, and meets regulatory compliance, or laws.

**[[Security frameworks]]** are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy. They have four core components:

1. [[Identifying and Documenting Security Goals]]
2. [[Setting Guidelines to Achieve Security Goals]]Â 
3. [[Implementing Strong Security Processes]]
4. [[Monitoring and Communicating Results]]

**[[Compliance]]** is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations.

	- Security involves more than just the virtual space. It also includes the physical, which is why many organizations have plans to maintain safety in the work environment. For example, access to a building may require using a key card or badge. 
	- Frameworks are used to create plans to address security risks, threats, and vulnerabilities, controls are used to reduce specific risks. If proper controls are not in place, an organization could face significant financial impacts and damage to their reputation because of exposure to risks including trespassing, creating fake employee accounts, or providing free benefits.
