## Playbook overview

A **[[playbook]]** is a manual that provides details about any operational action. Essentially, a playbook provides a predefined and up-to-date list of steps to perform when responding to an incident.

[[Playbook]]s are accompanied by a strategy. The strategy outlines expectations of team members who are assigned a task, and some playbooks also list the individuals responsible. The outlined expectations are accompanied by a plan. The plan dictates how the specific task outlined in the playbook must be completed.

[[Playbook]]s should be treated as living documents, which means that they are frequently updated by security team members to address industry changes and new threats. Playbooks are generally managed as a collaborative effort, since security team members have different levels of expertise.

Updates are often made if:

- A failure is identified, such as an oversight in the outlined policies and procedures, or in the playbook itself.Â 
- There is a change in industry standards, such as changes in laws or regulatory compliance.
- The cybersecurity landscape changes due to evolving threat actor tactics and technique

**Purpose of Playbooks:** **[[Playbook]]** offers security professionals a structured and well-organized approach to the entire incident response lifecycle. Incidents can be unpredictable and chaotic, and playbooks serve to provide order and clarity. They reduce guesswork and uncertainty, enabling security teams to respond quickly and effectively. Without playbooks, achieving an efficient and swift incident response becomes challenging.
