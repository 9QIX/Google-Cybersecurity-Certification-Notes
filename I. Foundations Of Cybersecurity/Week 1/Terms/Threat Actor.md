Threat actors are normally divided into five categories based on their motivations:

- **[[Competitors]]** refers to rival companies who pose a threat because they might benefit from leaked information.
- **[[State actors]]** are government intelligence agencies.
- **[[Criminal syndicates]]** refer to organized groups of people who make money from criminal activity.
- **[[Insider threats]]** can be any individual who has or had authorized access to an organization’s resources. This includes employees who accidentally compromise assets or individuals who purposefully put them at risk for their own benefit.
- **[[Shadow IT]]** refers to individuals who use technologies that lack IT governance. A common example is when an employee uses their personal email to send work-related communications.

In the digital attack surface, these threat actors often gain unauthorized access by hacking into systems. By definition, a **[[hacker]]** is any person who uses computers to gain access to computer systems, networks, or data. Similar to the term threat actor, hacker is also an umbrella term. When used alone, the term fails to capture a threat actor’s intentions.
