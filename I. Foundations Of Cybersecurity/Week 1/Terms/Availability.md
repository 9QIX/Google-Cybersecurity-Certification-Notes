**[[Availability]]** means data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it. Inaccessible data isn't useful and can prevent people from being able to do their jobs. As a security professional, ensuring that systems, networks, and applications are functioning properly to allow for timely and reliable access, may be a part of your everyday work responsibilities. 

### **Availability**

**[[Availability]]** is the idea that data is accessible to those who are authorized to use it. When a system adheres to both availability and confidentiality principles, data can be used when needed. 
	In the workplace, this could mean that the organization allows remote employees to access its internal network to perform their jobs. It’s worth noting that access to data on the internal network is still limited, depending on what type of access employees need to do their jobs. 
	If, for example, an employee works in the organization’s accounting department, they might need access to corporate accounts but not data related to ongoing development projects.
