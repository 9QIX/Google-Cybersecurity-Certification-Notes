- **[[Integrity]]** means the data is correct, authentic, and reliable. Determining the integrity of data and analyzing how it's used will help you, as a security professional, decide whether the data can or cannot be trusted. 
	- To maintain integrity, security professionals can use a form of data protection like encryption to safeguard data from being tampered with.

### **Integrity**

**[[Integrity]]** is the idea that the data is ***verifiably correct, authentic, and reliable***. ***Having protocols in place to verify the authenticity of data is essential***. 
	One way to verify data integrity is through [cryptography](https://www.nist.gov/cryptography#:~:text=Cryptography%20uses%20mathematical%20techniques%20to,that%20drives%20research%20and%20innovation.), which is used to transform data so unauthorized parties cannot read or tamper with it (NIST, 2022). 
	Another example of how an organization might implement integrity is by enabling [[encryption]], which is the process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format. Encryption can be used to prevent access and ensure data, such as messages on an organization's internal chat platform, cannot be tampered with.
