**[[Active packet sniffing]]**: A type of attack where data packets are manipulated in transit
**[[Botnet]]**: A collection of computers infected by malware that are under the control of a single threat actor, known as the “bot-herder"

**[[Denial of service (DoS) attack]]**: An attack that targets a network or server and floods it with network traffic

**[[Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack]]**: A type of denial of service attack that uses multiple devices or servers located in different locations to flood the target network with unwanted traffic

**[[Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)]]**: An internet protocol used by devices to tell each other about data transmission errors across the network

**[[Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) flood]]**: A type of DoS attack performed by an attacker repeatedly sending ICMP request packets to a network server

**[[IP spoofing]]**: A network attack performed when an attacker changes the source IP of a data packet to impersonate an authorized system and gain access to a network

**[[On-path attack]]**: An attack where a malicious actor places themselves in the middle of an authorized connection and intercepts or alters the data in transit

**[[Packet sniffing]]**: The practice of capturing and inspecting data packets across a network 

**[[Passive packet sniffing]]**: A type of attack where a malicious actor connects to a network hub and looks at all traffic on the network

**[[Ping of death]]**: A type of DoS attack caused when a hacker pings a system by sending it an oversized ICMP packet that is bigger than 64KB

**[[Replay attack]]**: A network attack performed when a malicious actor intercepts a data packet in transit and delays it or repeats it at another time

**[[Smurf attack]]**: A network attack performed when an attacker sniffs an authorized user’s IP address and floods it with ICMP packets

**[[Synchronize (SYN) flood attack]]**: A type of DoS attack that simulates a TCP/IP connection and floods a server with SYN packets
