## Network interception attacks 

**[[Network interception attacks]]** work by *intercepting network traffic and stealing valuable information* or interfering with the transmission in some way.

**[[Malicious actors]]** can use hardware or software tools to capture and inspect data in transit. This is referred to as **[[packet sniffing]]**. In addition to seeing information that they are not entitled to, malicious actors can also intercept network traffic and alter it. These attacks can cause damage to an organization’s network by inserting malicious code modifications or altering the message and interrupting network operations. For example, an attacker can intercept a bank transfer and change the account receiving the funds to one that the attacker controls.

Later in this course you will learn more about malicious packet sniffing, and other types of network interception attacks: on-path attacks and replay attacks.
