**[[Ping of Death Attack]]**:
- A **Ping of Death Attack** is a DoS attack where hackers send oversized ICMP packets (larger than 64 kilobytes, the maximum size for a correctly formed ICMP packet) to a vulnerable network server.
- The oversized ICMP packet overloads the system, causing it to crash.
- This attack analogy is likened to dropping a large rock on an anthill, where individual ants can carry a certain amount of weight, but a large rock crushes many ants, rendering the colony unable to function until it rebuilds.
