**[[On-Path Attacks]]:** On-path attacks involve the malicious actor positioning themselves between two devices engaged in an authorized connection. This intermediary position allows them to intercept and potentially modify data packets in transit. By sniffing packet information, attackers can learn the IP and MAC addresses of communicating devices, enabling them to impersonate either of these devices.
