**[[ICMP Flood Attack]]**:
- An **ICMP Flood Attack** is another type of DoS attack where attackers repeatedly send ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to a network server.
- ICMP is used by devices to report data transmission errors across the network.
- Attackers force the server to send ICMP packets in response, eventually depleting all incoming and outgoing bandwidth, causing the server to crash.
