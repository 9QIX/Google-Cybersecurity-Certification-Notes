**[[Firewall Configuration]]:** Firewalls can be configured to guard against IP spoofing. By monitoring incoming packets, a firewall can detect IP spoofing attempts. If a packet arrives with a sender's IP address matching that of the private network, it can be denied since devices with that IP address should already belong to the local network. Administrators can establish rules to reject incoming traffic with IP addresses identical to the local network.
