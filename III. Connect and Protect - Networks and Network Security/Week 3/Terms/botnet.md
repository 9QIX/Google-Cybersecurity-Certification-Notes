## Leading up to the attack

Before the attack on the service provider, a group of university students created a botnet with the intention to attack various gaming servers and networks. A **[[botnet]]** is a collection of computers infected by malware that are under the control of a single threat actor, known as the “bot-herder." Each computer in the botnet can be remotely controlled to send a data packet to a target system. In a botnet attack, cyber criminals instruct all the bots on the botnet to send data packets to the target system at the same time, resulting in a DDoS attack.

The group of university students posted the code for the botnet online so that it would be accessible to thousands of internet users and authorities wouldn’t be able to trace the botnet back to the students. In doing so, they made it possible for other malicious actors to learn the code to the botnet and control it remotely. This included the cyber criminals who attacked the DNS service provider.
