## tcpdump 

**[[tcpdump]]** is a command-line *network protocol analyzer*. It is popular, lightweight–meaning it uses little memory and has a low CPU usage–and uses the open-source libpcap library. tcpdump is text based, meaning all commands in tcpdump are executed in the terminal. It can also be installed on other Unix-based operating systems, such as macOS®. It is preinstalled on many Linux distributions.

tcpdump provides a brief packet analysis and *converts key information about network traffic into formats easily read by humans*. It prints information about each packet directly into your terminal. tcpdump also displays the source IP address, destination IP addresses, and the port numbers being used in the communications.

**[[tcpdump]]:** **[[KALI LINUX™]]** includes tcpdump, a command-line packet analyzer that allows security professionals to capture and inspect network traffic, a fundamental component of digital forensics.
