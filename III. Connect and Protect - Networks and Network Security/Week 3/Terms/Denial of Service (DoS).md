# Real-life DDoS attack

Previously, you were introduced to **[[Denial of Service (DoS)]]** attacks. You also learned that volumetric distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks overwhelm a network by sending unwanted data packets in such large quantities that the servers become unable to service normal users. This can be detrimental to an organization. When systems fail, organizations cannot meet their customers' needs. They often lose money, and in some cases, incur other losses. An organizationâ€™s reputation may also suffer if news of a successful DDoS attack reaches consumers, who then question the security of the organization.
