- **[[Financial]]**: When a system is taken offline with a DoS attack, or business operations are halted or slowed down by some other tactic, they prevent a company from performing the tasks that generate revenue. Depending on the size of an organization, interrupted operations can cost millions of dollars. In addition, if a malicious actor gets access to the personal information of the companyâ€™s clients or customers, the company may face heavy litigation and settlement costs if customers seek legal recourse.
