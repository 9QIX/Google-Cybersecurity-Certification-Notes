**[[SYN Flood Attack]]**:
- A **SYN Flood Attack** is a specific type of DoS attack that simulates the TCP connection handshake process and floods the server with SYN packets.
- During the TCP handshake, a device sends a SYN (synchronize) request to the server, which responds with a SYN/ACK packet.
- Malicious actors flood the server with SYN requests, aiming to exceed the available ports on the server and render it overwhelmed and unresponsive.
