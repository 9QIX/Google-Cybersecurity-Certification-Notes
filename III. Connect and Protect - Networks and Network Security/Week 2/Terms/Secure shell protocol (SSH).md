## Secure shell

**[[Secure shell protocol (SSH)]]** is used to create ***a secure connection with a remote system***. This *application layer* protocol provides an alternative for secure authentication and encrypted communication. SSH operates over the TCP port 22 and is a replacement for less secure protocols, such as Telnet.
