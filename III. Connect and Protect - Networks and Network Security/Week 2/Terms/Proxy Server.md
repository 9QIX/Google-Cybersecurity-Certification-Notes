# Proxy servers

- A **[[Proxy Server]]** is a network security system that serves as an intermediary between a client and other servers on the internet.
- It fulfills client requests by forwarding them to their intended destinations, enhancing security and privacy.
- The proxy server is a dedicated server positioned between the internet and the organization's internal network.

### **Proxy servers** 

A **[[proxy server]]** is another way to add security to your private network. Proxy servers utilize network address translation (NAT) to serve as a barrier between clients on the network and external threats. Forward proxies handle queries from internal clients when they access resources external to the network. Reverse proxies function opposite of forward proxies; they handle requests from external systems to services on the internal network. Some proxy servers can also be configured with rules, like a firewall.  For example, you can create filters to block websites identified as containing malware.
