 **[[Stateless Firewalls]]**: In contrast, stateless firewalls operate based on predefined rules and do not maintain knowledge about the state of connections. They rely solely on preconfigured rules set by a firewall administrator. These rules dictate what traffic is accepted and what is rejected. Stateless firewalls do not store analyzed information or identify trends as stateful firewalls do. Consequently, they are generally considered less secure.
