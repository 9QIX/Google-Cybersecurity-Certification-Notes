Security zones are a fundamental aspect of **[[network segmentation]]**, a security technique that divides a network into segments, each with its own access permissions and security rules.

- **[[network segmentation]]** is a security practice that divides a network into segments, each with its own unique security controls and rules.
- These segments help enhance network security by controlling access and limiting the impact of security incidents.

Security analysts also use **[[network segmentation]]** to create isolated subnets for different departments in an organization, preventing issues in one subnet from affecting the whole company and ensuring that only specified users have access to the parts of the network they require for their roles. Network segmentation may also be used to separate different security zones, with restricted zones containing highly classified or confidential data being separate from the rest of the network.
