**[[Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)]]** is a method of assigning subnet masks to IP addresses to create a subnet. Classless addressing replaces classful addressing. **[[Classful addressing]]** was used in the 1980s as a system of grouping IP addresses into classes (Class A to Class E). Each class included a limited number of IP addresses, which were depleted as the number of devices connecting to the internet outgrew the classful range in the 1990s. Classless CIDR addressing expanded the number of available IPv4 addresses.Â
