**CIDR** allows cybersecurity professionals to segment classful networks into smaller chunks. CIDR IP addresses are formatted like IPv4 addresses, but they include a slash (“/’”) followed by a number at the end of the address, This extra number is called the **[[IP network prefix]]**.  For example, a regular IPv4 address uses the 198.51.100.0 format, whereas a CIDR IP address would include the IP network prefix at the end of the address, 198.51.100.0/24. This CIDR address encompasses all IP addresses between 198.51.100.0 and 198.51.100.255. The system of CIDR addressing reduces the number of entries in routing tables and provides more available IP addresses within networks. You can try converting CIDR to IPv4 addresses and vice versa through an online conversion tool, like [IPAddressGuide](https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr), for practice and to better understand this concept.
