A **[[network protocol]]** is a ***set of rules used by two or more devices*** on a network to describe the order of delivery and the structure of data. Network protocols serve as ***instructions that come with the information*** in the data packet. These instructions tell the receiving device what to do with the data. **Protocols** are like a common language that allows devices all across the world to communicate with and understand each other.
