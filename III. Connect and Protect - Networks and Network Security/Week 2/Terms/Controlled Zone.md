**Types of Security Zones**:
- An organization's network is typically classified into two types of security zones: **[[Uncontrolled Zone]]** and **[[Controlled Zone]]**.
- The **[[Uncontrolled Zone]]** refers to any network outside the organization's control, such as the internet.
- The **[[Controlled Zone]]** consists of subnets that protect the internal network from the uncontrolled zone.

**Components of the Controlled Zone**:
- Within the **[[Controlled Zone]]**, there are several types of networks, including:
   - **[[Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)]]**: The DMZ contains public-facing services that can access the internet, such as web servers, proxy servers, DNS servers, email servers, and file servers for external communications.
   - **[[Internal Network]]**: This network houses private servers and sensitive data that the organization needs to protect.
   - **[[Restricted Zone]]**: The restricted zone safeguards highly confidential information and limits access to employees with specific privileges.
