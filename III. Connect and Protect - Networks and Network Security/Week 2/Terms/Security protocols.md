### **Security Protocols**

**[[Security protocols]]** are network protocols that ensure that ***data is sent and received securely*** across a network. Security protocols use encryption algorithms to protect data in transit. Below are some common security protocols.

- **[[Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)]]** is a network protocol that provides a ***secure method of communication between clients and website*** servers. 
	- HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that uses secure sockets layer/transport layer security (SSL/TLS) encryption on all transmissions so that malicious actors cannot read the information contained. 
	- HTTPS uses **port 443**. In the TCP/IP model, HTTPS occurs at the **application layer**.
	- Port 443
- **[[Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)]]** is a ***secure protocol used to transfer files*** from one device to another over a network. 
	- SFTP uses secure shell (SSH), typically through TCP **port 22**. SSH uses [[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)]] and other types of encryption to ensure that unintended recipients cannot intercept the transmissions. 
	- In the TCP/IP model, SFTP occurs at the **application layer**. 
	- SFTP is used ***often with cloud storage***. Every time a user uploads or downloads a file from cloud storage, the file is transferred using the SFTP protocol.
