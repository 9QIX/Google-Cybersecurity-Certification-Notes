- **[[Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)]]** is a network protocol used for ***monitoring and managing devices on a network***. 
	- SNMP can reset a password on a network device or change its baseline configuration. 
	- It can also send requests to network devices for a report on how much of the networkâ€™s bandwidth is being used up. In the TCP/IP model, SNMP occurs at the **application layer**.
	- SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c use **UDP port 161** for sending and receiving SNMP requests and responses.
	- SNMPv3 uses **UDP port 161** for SNMP requests and **UDP port 162** for SNMP traps, which are asynchronous notifications sent by devices to a management station.
