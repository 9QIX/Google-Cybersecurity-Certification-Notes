#### **WPA3**

**[[WPA3]]** is a secure Wi-Fi protocol and is growing in usage as more WPA3 compatible devices are released. These are the key differences between WPA2 and WPA3:

- WPA3 addresses the authentication handshake vulnerability to KRACK attacks, which is present in WPA2.Â 
- WPA3 uses **[[Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)]]**, a password-authenticated, cipher-key-sharing agreement. This prevents attackers from downloading data from wireless network connections to their systems to attempt to decode it.
- WPA3 has increased encryption to make passwords more secure by using 128-bit encryption, with WPA3-Enterprise mode offering optional 192-bit encryption.
