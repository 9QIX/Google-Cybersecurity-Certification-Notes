A VPN is a service that encrypts data in transit and disguises your IP address. VPNs use a process called encapsulation. Encapsulation wraps your encrypted data in an unencrypted data packet, which allows your data to be sent across the public network while remaining anonymous. Enterprises and other organizations use VPNs to help protect communications from users’ devices to corporate resources. Some of these resources include connecting to servers or virtual machines that host business applications. VPNs can also be used for personal use to increase personal privacy. They allow the user to access the internet without anyone being able to read their personal information or access their private IP address. Organizations are increasingly using a combination of VPN and SD-WAN capabilities to secure their networks. A software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) is a virtual WAN service that allows organizations to securely connect users to applications across multiple locations and over large geographical distances.
