**Use of Proxy Servers**:
- **[[Proxy servers]]** can obfuscate the IP addresses of an organization's web servers in responses, improving security.
- They are employed to block access to unsafe websites, restricting user access based on an organization's policies.
- To enhance performance and security, **[[Proxy servers]]** cache frequently requested data temporarily, reducing the need for repeated access to internal servers.
