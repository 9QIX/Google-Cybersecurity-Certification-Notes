## Telnet 

**[[Telnet]]** is an *application layer* protocol that allows a device to communicate with another device or server. Telnet ***sends all information in clear text***. It uses command line prompts to control another device similar to secure shell (SSH), but Telnet is not as secure as SSH. Telnet can be used to connect to local or remote devices and uses TCP port 23.
