- **[[Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)]]** is a ***secure protocol used to transfer files*** from one device to another over a network. 
	- SFTP uses secure shell (SSH), typically through TCP **port 22**. SSH uses [[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)]] and other types of encryption to ensure that unintended recipients cannot intercept the transmissions. 
	- In the TCP/IP model, SFTP occurs at the **application layer**. 
	- SFTP is used ***often with cloud storage***. Every time a user uploads or downloads a file from cloud storage, the file is transferred using the SFTP protocol.
