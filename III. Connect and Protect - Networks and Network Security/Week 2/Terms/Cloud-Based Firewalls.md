**[[Cloud-Based Firewalls]]**: Cloud service providers offer **Firewalls as a Service (FaaS)** for organizations. These firewalls are *software-based and hosted by the cloud service provider*. They allow organizations to configure firewall rules through the cloud provider's interface. Cloud-based firewalls inspect all incoming traffic before it reaches the organization's onsite network. They also safeguard cloud-hosted assets and processes used by the organization.
