SSH uses [[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)]] and other types of encryption to ensure that unintended recipients cannot intercept the transmissions. In the TCP/IP model, SFTP occurs at the application layer. SFTP is used often with cloud storage. Every time a user uploads or downloads a file from cloud storage, the file is transferred using the SFTP protocol.

_[[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)]]_ is one of the most secure symmetric algorithms today. AES generates keys that are 128, 192, or 256 bits. Cryptographic keys of this size are considered to be safe from brute force attacks. Itâ€™s estimated that brute forcing an AES 128-bit key could take a modern computer billions of years!
