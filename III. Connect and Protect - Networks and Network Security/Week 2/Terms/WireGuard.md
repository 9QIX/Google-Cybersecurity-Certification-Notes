### WireGuard VPN

**[[WireGuard]]** is a high-speed VPN protocol, with advanced encryption, to protect users when they are accessing the internet. Itâ€™s designed to be simple to set up and maintain. WireGuard can be used for both site-to-site connection and client-server connections. WireGuard is relatively newer than IPSec, and is used by many people due to the fact that its download speed is enhanced by using fewer lines of code. WireGuard is also open source, which makes it easier for users to deploy and debug. This protocol is useful for processes that require faster download speeds, such as streaming video content or downloading large files.
