Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) is a security protocol used in **Wi-Fi** networks, specifically in the **WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3)** security standard. In simpler terms:

Imagine you have a secret code (a *password*) that you want to share securely with someone. SAE is like a method for both you and the other person to exchange your secret codes without anyone else knowing. It's a way to establish a *secure connection* between your device (like your *phone* or *laptop*) and a *Wi-Fi network*.

SAE is designed to make it very difficult for anyone to eavesdrop on your *Wi-Fi password* while you're connecting to a network, making your *Wi-Fi connection* more secure. It's a key part of the improved security in *WPA3*, which is the latest standard for securing Wi-Fi networks.

WPA3 uses **[[Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)]]**, a password-authenticated, cipher-key-sharing agreement. This prevents attackers from downloading data from wireless network connections to their systems to attempt to decode it.
