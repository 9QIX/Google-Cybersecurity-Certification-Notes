Hashing converts information into a unique value that can then be used to determine its integrity. It is a one-way function, meaning it is impossible to decrypt and obtain the original text.

### **Hashing and salting**

**[[Hashing]]** converts information into a unique value that can then be used to determine its integrity. **[[Salting]]** is an additional safeguard thatâ€™s used to strengthen hash functions. It works by adding random characters to data, like passwords. This increases the length and complexity of hash values, making them harder to brute force and less susceptible to dictionary attacks.
