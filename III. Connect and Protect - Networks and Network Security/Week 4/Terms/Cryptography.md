## Cryptography in the cloud

**[[Cryptography]]** can be applied to secure data that is processed and stored in a cloud environment. Cryptography uses encryption and secure key management systems to provide data integrity and confidentiality. Cryptographic encryption is one of the key ways to secure sensitive data and information in the cloud.

Encryption is the process of scrambling information into ciphertext, which is not readable to anyone without the encryption key. Encryption primarily originated from manually encoding messages and information using an algorithm to convert any given letter or number to a new value. Modern encryption relies on the secrecy of a key, rather than the secrecy of an algorithm. Cryptography is an important tool that helps secure cloud networks and data at rest to prevent unauthorized access. Youâ€™ll learn more about cryptography in-depth in an upcoming course.

**[[Cryptography]]:** Cryptography is the practice of converting data into an unreadable form (ciphertext) through encryption, and then back into its original, readable form (plaintext) using decryption. It is a fundamental security control for protecting information online.
