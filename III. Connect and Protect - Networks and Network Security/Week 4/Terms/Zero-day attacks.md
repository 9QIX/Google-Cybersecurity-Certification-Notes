### Zero-day attacks

**[[Zero-day attacks]]** are an important security consideration for organizations using cloud or traditional on-premise network solutions. A **zero day** attack is an exploit that was previously unknown. CSPs are more likely to know about a zero day attack occurring before a traditional IT organization does. CSPs have ways of patching hypervisors and migrating workloads to other virtual machines. These methods ensure the customers are not impacted by the attack. There are also several tools available for patching at the operating system level that organizations can use.
