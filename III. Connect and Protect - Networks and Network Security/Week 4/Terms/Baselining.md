### Baselining

**[[Baselining]]** for cloud networks and operations cover how the cloud environment is configured and set up. A baseline is a fixed reference point. This reference point can be used to compare changes made to a cloud environment. Proper configuration and setup can greatly improve the security and performance of a cloud environment. Examples of establishing a baseline in a cloud environment include: restricting access to the admin portal of the cloud environment, enabling password management, enabling file encryption, and enabling threat detection services for SQL databases.
