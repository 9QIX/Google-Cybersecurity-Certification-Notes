**[[Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)]]:** MFA is an advanced security measure that requires users to verify their identity through two or more authentication methods. These methods may include something the user knows (e.g., a password), something they have (e.g., an ID card), or something unique about them (e.g., a fingerprint). MFA significantly enhances security by adding an extra layer of authentication.
