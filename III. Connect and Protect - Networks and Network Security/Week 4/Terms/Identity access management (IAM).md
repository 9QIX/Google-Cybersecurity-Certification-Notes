### Identity access management

**[[Identity access management (IAM)]]** is a collection of processes and technologies that helps organizations manage digital identities in their environment. This service also authorizes how users can use different cloud resources. A common problem that organizations face when using the cloud is the loose configuration of cloud user roles. An improperly configured user role increases risk by allowing unauthorized users to have access to critical cloud operations.Â
