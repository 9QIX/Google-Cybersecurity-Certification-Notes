**[[Hardware]]:** Securing physical devices to prevent unauthorized access.

### Hardware

The **[[hardware]]** is where all the processing is done to complete the tasks initiated by the user. For example, when a user wants to calculate a number, the CPU figures out the answer. As another example, when a user wants to save a file, another component of the hardware, the hard drive, handles this task.Â 

After the work is done by the hardware, it sends the output back through the operating system to the application so that it can display the results to the user.
