## Brute force attacks

A **[[brute force attack]]** is a trial-and-error process of discovering private information. There are different types of brute force attacks that malicious actors use to guess passwords, including: 

- _[[Simple brute force attacks]]._ When attackers try to guess a user's login credentials, it’s considered a simple brute force attack. They might do this by entering any combination of usernames and passwords that they can think of until they find the one that works.
- _[[Dictionary attacks]]_ use a similar technique. In dictionary attacks, attackers use a list of commonly used passwords and stolen credentials from previous breaches to access a system. These are called “dictionary” attacks because attackers originally used a list of words from the dictionary to guess the passwords, before complex password rules became a common security practice. 

Using brute force to access a system can be a tedious and time consuming process, especially when it’s done manually. There are a range of tools attackers use to conduct their attacks.

**[[Brute Force Attack]]:** A brute force attack is a trial-and-error method for discovering private information by systematically trying all possible combinations. In the context of Caesar's Cipher, it involves attempting all 26 shift values to decrypt the message.

## The importance of key length

Ciphers are vulnerable to **[[brute force attacks]]**, which use a trial and error process to discover private information. This tactic is the digital equivalent of trying every number in a combination lock trying to find the right one. In modern encryption, longer key lengths are considered to be more secure. Longer key lengths mean more possibilities that an attacker needs to try to unlock a cipher.

One drawback to having long encryption keys is slower processing times. Although short key lengths are generally less secure, they’re much faster to compute. Providing fast data communication online while keeping information safe is a delicate balancing act.
