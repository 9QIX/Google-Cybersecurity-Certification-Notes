## Brute force attacks

A **[[brute force attack]]** is a trial-and-error process of discovering private information. There are different types of brute force attacks that malicious actors use to guess passwords, including: 

- _[[Simple brute force attacks]]._ When attackers try to guess a user's login credentials, it’s considered a simple brute force attack. They might do this by entering any combination of usernames and passwords that they can think of until they find the one that works.
- _[[Dictionary attacks]]_ use a similar technique. In dictionary attacks, attackers use a list of commonly used passwords and stolen credentials from previous breaches to access a system. These are called “dictionary” attacks because attackers originally used a list of words from the dictionary to guess the passwords, before complex password rules became a common security practice. 

Using brute force to access a system can be a tedious and time consuming process, especially when it’s done manually. There are a range of tools attackers use to conduct their attacks.

**[[Brute Force Attack]]:** A brute force attack is a trial-and-error method for discovering private information by systematically trying all possible combinations. In the context of Caesar's Cipher, it involves attempting all 26 shift values to decrypt the message.
