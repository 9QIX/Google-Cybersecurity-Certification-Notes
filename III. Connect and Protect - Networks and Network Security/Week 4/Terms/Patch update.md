## Patching gaps in security

An outdated computer is a lot like a house with unlocked doors. Malicious actors use these gaps in security the same way, to gain unauthorized access. Software updates are similar to locking the doors to keep them out.

A **[[patch update]]** is a software and operating system update that addresses security vulnerabilities within a program or product. Patches usually contain bug fixes that address common security vulnerabilities and exposures.

**Note:** Ideally, patches address common vulnerabilities and exposures before malicious hackers find them. However, patches are sometimes developed as a result of a **zero-day**, which is an exploit that was previously unknown.
