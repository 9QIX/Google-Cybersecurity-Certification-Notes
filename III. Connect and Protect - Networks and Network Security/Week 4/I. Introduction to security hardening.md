# Security Hardening

**Security hardening** is a crucial process employed by security analysts and organizations to *proactively strengthen systems and reduce their vulnerability* to cyberattacks. 

This practice aims to *minimize the attack surface*, which encompasses all potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit to compromise a system. To illustrate this concept, let's use an analogy comparing a network to a house. 

In this analogy, the attack surface represents all the doors and windows through which a burglar could gain access to the house. Similar to fortifying a house by installing locks on doors and windows, security hardening involves minimizing potential vulnerabilities to ensure network security.

**Scope of Security Hardening:**
Security hardening encompasses a wide range of activities and maintenance procedures performed by security analysts to maintain the security and optimal functionality of network devices and systems. It is applicable to various components, including:
- **Hardware:** Securing physical devices to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Operating Systems:** Implementing security measures to protect the underlying software.
- **Applications:** Configuring applications for enhanced security and vulnerability mitigation.
- **Computer Networks:** Safeguarding network infrastructure to prevent intrusions.
- **Databases:** Applying security controls to protect sensitive data.
- **Physical Security:** Including measures such as security cameras and guards to protect physical spaces.

**Common Security Hardening Procedures:**
1. **Software Updates (Patches):** Regularly applying software updates or patches is a fundamental security hardening practice. These updates address security vulnerabilities and enhance system security.
2. **Configuration Changes:** Security analysts may modify device and application configurations to increase security. For example, requiring longer passwords or more frequent password changes makes it harder for malicious actors to obtain login credentials.
3. **Encryption Updates:** Updating encryption standards for stored data enhances data protection by making it more challenging for attackers to access sensitive information within databases.
4. **Unused Application and Service Removal:** Removing or disabling unused applications and services reduces the potential attack surface. Attackers cannot exploit what is not present or active.
5. **Port Disabling:** Disabling unused ports on network devices reduces potential entry points for attackers.
6. **Access Permissions Reduction:** Minimizing access permissions across devices and networks ensures that only authorized personnel have access, reducing the risk of unauthorized intrusions.

**Penetration Testing:**
An essential aspect of security hardening is conducting regular penetration testing (pen testing). Penetration tests simulate cyberattacks to identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes. Penetration testers document their findings in detailed reports, which help security teams pinpoint specific vulnerabilities that need attention. Organizations can then devise plans to remediate these vulnerabilities, enhancing overall security.

Security hardening is a foundational element of network security, as it actively strengthens a network by reducing its potential points of vulnerability. By employing a combination of software updates, configuration changes, access control measures, and regular penetration testing, organizations can significantly enhance their cybersecurity posture, making it more challenging for threat actors to successfully breach their systems.
