## Layer 1: [[Physical layerÂ ]]

As the name suggests, the ***physical layer corresponds to the physical hardware*** involved in network transmission. Hubs, modems, and the cables and wiring that connect them are all considered part of the physical layer. 

To travel across an ethernet or coaxial cable, a data packet needs to be translated into a stream of 0s and 1s. The stream of 0s and 1s are sent across the physical wiring and cables, received, and then passed on to higher levels of the OSI model.
