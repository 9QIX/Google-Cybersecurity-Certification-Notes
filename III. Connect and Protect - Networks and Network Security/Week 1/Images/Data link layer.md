## Layer 2: [[Data link layer]]

The data link layer ***organizes sending and receiving data packets within a single network***. The data link layer is home to switches on the local network and network interface cards on local devices.

Protocols like network control protocol (NCP), high-level data link control (HDLC), and synchronous data link control protocol (SDLC) are used at the data link layer.
