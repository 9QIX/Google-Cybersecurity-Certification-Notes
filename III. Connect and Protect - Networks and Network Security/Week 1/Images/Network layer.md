## Layer 3: [[Network layer]]

The network layer ***oversees receiving the frames from the data link layer*** (layer 2) and ***delivers them to the intended destination***. The intended destination can be found based on the address that resides in the frame of the data packets. 

**[[Data packets]]** allow communication between two networks. These packets include IP addresses that tell routers where to send them. They are routed from the sending network to the receiving network.Â
