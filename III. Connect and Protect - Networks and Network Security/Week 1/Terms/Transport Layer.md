- ### **[[Transport Layer]]**
	- The transport layer includes ***protocols to control the flow of traffic across a network***. These protocols ***permit or deny communication*** with other devices and include information about the status of the connection. Activities of this layer include error control, which ensures data is flowing smoothly across the network.
## Transport layer

The **[[transport layer]]** is responsible for reliably delivering data between two systems or networks. TCP and UDP are the two transport protocols that occur at this layer.Â
