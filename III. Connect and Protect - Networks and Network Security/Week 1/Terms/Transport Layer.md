- ### **[[Transport Layer]]**
	- The transport layer includes ***protocols to control the flow of traffic across a network***. These protocols ***permit or deny communication*** with other devices and include information about the status of the connection. Activities of this layer include error control, which ensures data is flowing smoothly across the network.
## Transport layer

The **[[transport layer]]** is responsible for reliably delivering data between two systems or networks. TCP and UDP are the two transport protocols that occur at this layer. 

## Layer 4: [[Transport layer]]

The transport layer is responsible for ***delivering data between devices***. This layer also handles the ***speed of data transfer, flow of the transfer, and breaking data down into smaller segments to make them easier to transport***. 

**[[Segmentation]]** is the process of dividing up a large data transmission into smaller pieces that can be processed by the receiving system. These segments need to be reassembled at their destination so they can be processed at the session layer (layer 5). The speed and rate of the transmission also has to match the connection speed of the destination system. TCP and UDP are transport layer protocols.
