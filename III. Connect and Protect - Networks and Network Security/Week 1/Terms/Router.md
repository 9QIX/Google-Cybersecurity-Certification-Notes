- ### **[[Router]]**
	- A router is a network device that connects multiple networks together.
	- For example, if a computer in one network wants to send information to a tablet on another network, then the information will be transferred as follows: 
		- First, the information travels from the computer to the router. 
		- Then, the router reads the destination address, and forwards the data to the intended network's router. 
		- Finally, the receiving router directs that information to the tablet.
