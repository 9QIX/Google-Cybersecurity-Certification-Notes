## Using network diagrams as a security analyst

**[[Network diagrams]]** allow network administrators and security personnel to imagine the architecture and design of their organization’s private network.

Network diagrams are topographical maps that show the devices on the network and how they connect. Network diagrams use small representative graphics to portray each network device and dotted lines to show how each device connects to the other. Security analysts use network diagrams to learn about network architecture and how to design networks.
