A **[[network]]** is a ***group of connected devices***. 
	- At home, the devices connected to your network might be your laptop, cell phones, and smart devices, like your refrigerator or air conditioner. 
	- In an office, devices like workstations, printers, and servers all connect to the network. 
	- The devices on a network can communicate with each other over network cables, or wireless connections. Networks in your home and office can communicate with networks in other locations, and the devices on them. 

## Devices on a network 

**[[Network]]** devices are the devices that maintain information and services for users of a network. These devices connect over wired and wireless connections. After establishing a connection to the network, the devices send data packets. The data packets provide information about the source and the destination of the data.
