A **[[network]]** is a ***group of connected devices***. 
	- At home, the devices connected to your network might be your laptop, cell phones, and smart devices, like your refrigerator or air conditioner. 
	- In an office, devices like workstations, printers, and servers all connect to the network. 
	- The devices on a network can communicate with each other over network cables, or wireless connections. Networks in your home and office can communicate with networks in other locations, and the devices on them.
