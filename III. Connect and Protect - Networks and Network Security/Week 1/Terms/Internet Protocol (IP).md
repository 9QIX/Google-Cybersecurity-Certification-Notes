- **[[Internet Protocol (IP)]]**. IP sends the data packets to the correct destination and relies on the Transmission Control Protocol/User Datagram Protocol (TCP/UDP) to deliver them to the corresponding service. IP packets allow communication between two networks. They are routed from the sending network to the receiving network. The TCP/UDP retransmits any data that is lost or corrupt.
