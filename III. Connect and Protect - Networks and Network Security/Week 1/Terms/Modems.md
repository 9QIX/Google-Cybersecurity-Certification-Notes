**Modems**

**[[Modems]]** usually interface with an internet service provider (ISP). ISPs provide internet connectivity via telephone lines or coaxial cables. Modems receive transmissions from the internet and translate them into digital signals that can be understood by the devices on the network. Usually, modems connect to a router that takes the decoded transmissions and sends them on to the local network.

**Note:** Enterprise networks used by large organizations to connect their users and devices often use other broadband technologies to handle high-volume traffic, instead of using a modem.
