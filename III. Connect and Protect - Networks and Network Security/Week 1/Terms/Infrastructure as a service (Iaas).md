**[[Infrastructure as a service (Iaas)]]** refers to the use of virtual computer components offered by the CSP. These include virtual containers and storage that are configured remotely through the CSPâ€™s API or web console. Cloud-compute and storage services can be used to operate existing applications and other technology workloads without significant modifications.
