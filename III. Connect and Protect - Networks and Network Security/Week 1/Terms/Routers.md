### **Routers**

**[[Routers]]** sit between networks and direct traffic, based on the IP address of the destination network. The IP address of the destination network is contained in the IP header. The router reads the header information and forwards the packet to the next router on the path to the destination. This continues until the packet reaches the destination network. 

Routers can also include a firewall feature that allows or blocks incoming traffic based on information in the transmission. This stops malicious traffic from entering the private network and damaging the local area network.
