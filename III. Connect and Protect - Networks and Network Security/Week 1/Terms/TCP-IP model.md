# The four layers of TCP/IP model

The **[[TCP-IP model]]** is a framework that is used to visualize how data is organized and transmitted across the network. The TCP/IP model has four layers. The four layers are: the network access layer, the internet layer, the transport layer, and the application layer. Knowing how the TCP/IP model organizes network activity allows security professionals to monitor and secure against risks.

- ### [[Network Access Layer]]
	- Layer one is the network access layer. The network access layer ***deals with creation of data packets and their transmission across a network***. 
	- This includes ***hardware devices connected to physical cables and switches*** that direct data to its destination.
- ### [[Internet Layer]]
	- The internet layer is where ***IP addresses are attached to data packets to indicate the location of the sender and receiver***. 
	- The internet layer also focuses on ***how networks connect to each other***. For example, data packets containing information that determine whether they will stay on the LAN or will be sent to a remote network, like the internet.
- ### **[[Transport Layer]]**
	- The transport layer includes ***protocols to control the flow of traffic across a network***. These protocols ***permit or deny communication*** with other devices and include information about the status of the connection. Activities of this layer include error control, which ensures data is flowing smoothly across the network.
- ### **[[Application Layer]]**
	- Finally, at the application layer, protocols ***determine how the data packets will interact with receiving devices***. Functions that are organized at application layer include file transfers and email services.

## The TCP/IP model

The **TCP/IP model** is a framework used to visualize how data is organized and transmitted across a network. This model helps network engineers and network security analysts conceptualize processes on the network and communicate where disruptions or security threats occur. 

The TCP/IP model has four layers: network access layer, internet layer, transport layer, and application layer. When troubleshooting issues on the network, security professionals can analyze and deduce which layer or layers an attack occurred based on what processes were involved in an incident.
