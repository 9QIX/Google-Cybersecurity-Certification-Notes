- ### **[[Switch]]**
	- A switch makes connections between specific devices on a network by sending and receiving data between them. A switch is more intelligent than a hub. It only passes data to the intended destination. This makes switches more secure than hubs, and enables them to control the flow of traffic and improve network performance. 

### **Hubs and switches**

**[[Hub]]s** and **[[switch]]es** both direct traffic on a local network. 

A **[[switch]]** forwards packets between devices directly connected to it. It maintains a MAC address table that matches MAC addresses of devices on the network to port numbers on the switch and forwards incoming data packets according to the destination MAC address.
