## MAC Address

Another kind of address used in network communications is called a MAC address. A **[[MAC address]]** is a ***unique alphanumeric identifier that is assigned to each physical device*** on a network. When a switch receives a data packet, it reads the MAC address of the destination device and maps it to a port. 

It then keeps this information in a MAC address table. Think of the MAC address table like an address book that the switch uses to direct data packets to the appropriate device. 

Example 1:

| Port    | MAC Address          |
| ------- | -------------------- |
| Port 1  | 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E   |
| Port 2  | 08:00:27:AE:FD:42   |
| Port 3  | 5C:33:8E:9A:21:7F   |
| Port 4  | 3A:9F:C8:76:B2:1D   |
| Port 5  | 1B:6D:F0:5E:A2:C7   |

Example 2:

| Port    | MAC Address          |
| ------- | -------------------- |
| Port 1  | 00:0F:7C:12:34:56   |
| Port 2  | 4A:B7:81:29:63:DC   |
| Port 3  | 7E:8D:5F:18:92:A1   |
| Port 4  | 9D:2E:7A:C4:F6:0B   |
| Port 5  | A1:0C:3E:76:5B:9D   |

Example 3:

| Port    | MAC Address          |
| ------- | -------------------- |
| Port 1  | 08:00:27:3A:BC:EF   |
| Port 2  | 3C:FD:A2:58:6E:91   |
| Port 3  | 6A:17:E9:D4:87:2F   |
| Port 4  | 45:9B:FA:72:C5:38   |
| Port 5  | D7:80:14:5D:29:C6   |

These tables provide information about the MAC addresses associated with devices connected to different ports on a network switch. You can adapt and expand these tables to fit your specific needs.
