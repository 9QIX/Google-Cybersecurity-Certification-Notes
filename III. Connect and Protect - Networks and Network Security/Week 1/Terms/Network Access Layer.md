- ### [[Network Access Layer]]
	- Layer one is the network access layer. The network access layer ***deals with creation of data packets and their transmission across a network***. 
	- This includes ***hardware devices connected to physical cables and switches*** that direct data to its destination.

## Network access layerÂ 

The **[[network access layer]]**, sometimes called the ***data link layer***, organizes ***sending and receiving data frames within a single network***. This layer corresponds to the ***physical hardware*** involved in network transmission. 

Hubs, modems, cables, and wiring are all considered part of this layer. The **[[address resolution protocol (ARP)]]** is part of the network access layer. ARP ***assists IP with directing data packets*** on the same physical network by ***mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses*** on the same physical network.
