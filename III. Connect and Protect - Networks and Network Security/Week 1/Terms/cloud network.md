A **[[cloud network]]** is a collection of servers or computers that stores resources and data in a remote data center that can be accessed via the internet. Because companies don't house the servers at their physical location, these servers are referred to as being "in the cloud". 
	- Traditional networks host web servers from a business in its physical location. However, cloud networks are different from traditional networks because they use remote servers, which allow online services and web applications to be used from any geographic location. Cloud security will become increasingly relevant to many security professionals as more organizations migrate to cloud services. 
	- Cloud service providers offer cloud computing to maintain applications. For example, they provide on-demand storage and processing power that their customers only pay as needed. They also provide business and web analytics that organizations can use to monitor their web traffic and sales.
