- ### **[[Hub]]**
	- A hub is a network device that broadcasts information to every device on the network. Think of a hub like a radio tower that broadcasts a signal to any radio tuned to the correct frequency. 

### **Hubs and switches**

**[[Hub]]s** and **[[switch]]es** both direct traffic on a local network. 

A **[[hub]]** is a device that provides a common point of connection for all devices directly connected to it. Hubs additionally repeat all information out to all ports. From a security perspective, this makes hubs vulnerable to eavesdropping. For this reason, hubs are not used as often on modern networks; most organizations use switches instead.
