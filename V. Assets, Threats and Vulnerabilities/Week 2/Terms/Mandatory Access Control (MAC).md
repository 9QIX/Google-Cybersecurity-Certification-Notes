MAC is the strictest of the three frameworks. Authorization in this model is based on a strict need-to-know basis. Access to information must be granted manually by a central authority or system administrator. For example, MAC is commonly applied in law enforcement, military, and other government agencies where users must request access through a chain of command. MAC is also known as non-discretionary control because access isnâ€™t given at the discretion of the data owner.
