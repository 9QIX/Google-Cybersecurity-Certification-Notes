# The evolution of hash functions

Hash functions are important controls that are part of every company's security strategy. Hashing is widely used for authentication and **[[non-repudiation]]**, the concept that the authenticity of information can’t be denied.

Previously, you learned that **[[hash functions]]** are algorithms that produce a code that can't be decrypted. Hash functions convert information into a unique value that can then be used to determine its integrity. In this reading, you’ll learn about the origins of hash functions and how they’ve changed over time.
