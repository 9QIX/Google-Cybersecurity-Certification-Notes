### **[[Account change audits]]**

Account directory services keep records and logs associated with each user. Changes to an account are usually saved and can be used to audit the directory for suspicious activity, like multiple attempts to change an account password. Performing account change audits helps to ensure that all account changes are made by authorized users.

**Note:** Most directory services can be configured to alert system administrators of suspicious activity.
