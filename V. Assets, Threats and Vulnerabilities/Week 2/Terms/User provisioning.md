Back-end systems need to be able to verify whether the information provided by a user is accurate. To accomplish this, users must be properly provisioned. **[[User provisioning]]** is the process of creating and maintaining a user's digital identity. For example, a college might create a new user account when a new instructor is hired. The new account will be configured to provide access to instructor-only resources while they are teaching. Security analysts are routinely involved with provisioning users and their access privileges.

**Pro tip:** Another role analysts have in IAM is to deprovision users. This is an important practice that removes a user's access rights when they should no longer have them.
