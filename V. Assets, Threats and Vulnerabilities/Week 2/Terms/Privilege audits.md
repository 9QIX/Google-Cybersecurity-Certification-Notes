### **[[Privilege audits]]**

Users tend to accumulate more access privileges than they need over time, an issue known as _privilege creep_. This might occur if an employee receives a promotion or switches teams and their job duties change. Privilege audits assess whether a user's role is in alignment with the resources they have access to.
