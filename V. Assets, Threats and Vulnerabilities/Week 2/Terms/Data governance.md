Businesses handle massive amounts of data every day. New information is constantly being collected from internal and external sources. A structured approach to managing all of this data is the best way to keep it private and secure.

**[[Data governance]]** is a set of processes that define how an organization manages information. Governance often includes policies that specify how to keep data private, accurate, available, and secure throughout its lifecycle.

Effective data governance is a collaborative activity that relies on people. Data governance policies commonly categorize individuals into a specific role:

- **[[Data owner]]:** the person that decides who can access, edit, use, or destroy their information.
- **[[Data custodian]]**: anyone or anything that's responsible for the safe handling, transport, and storage of information.
- **[[Data steward]]**: the person or group that maintains and implements data governance policies set by an organization.

Businesses store, move, and transform data using a wide range of IT systems. Data governance policies often assign accountability to data owners, custodians, and stewards.

**Note:** As a data custodian, you will primarily beÂ  responsible for maintaining security and privacy rules for your organization.
