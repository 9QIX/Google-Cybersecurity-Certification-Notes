MD5 values are limited to 32 characters in length. Due to the limited output size, the algorithm is considered to be vulnerable to **[[hash collision]]**, an instance when different inputs produce the same hash value. Because hashes are used for authentication, a hash collision is similar to copying someoneâ€™s identity. Attackers can carry out collision attacks to fraudulently impersonate authentic data.
