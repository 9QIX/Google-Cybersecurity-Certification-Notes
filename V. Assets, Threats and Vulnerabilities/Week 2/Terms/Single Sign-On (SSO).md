**[[Single Sign-On (SSO)]]:** Single Sign-On is a technology that combines various logins into a single login, reducing the need for users to authenticate repeatedly. SSO streamlines the authentication process, but it can pose vulnerabilities when used alone.

## A better approach to authentication

**[[Single sign-on (SSO)]]** is a technology that combines several different logins into one. More companies are turning to SSO as a solution to their authentication needs for three reasons:

1. **SSO improves the user experience** by eliminating the number of usernames and passwords people have to remember.
2. **Companies can lower costs** by streamlining how they manage connected services.
3. **SSO improves overall security** by reducing the number of access points attackers can target.

This technology became available in the mid-1990s as a way to combat _password fatigue_, which refers to peopleâ€™s tendency to reuse passwords across services. Remembering many different passwords can be a challenge, but using the same password repeatedly is a major security risk. SSO solves this dilemma by shifting the burden of authentication away from the user.
