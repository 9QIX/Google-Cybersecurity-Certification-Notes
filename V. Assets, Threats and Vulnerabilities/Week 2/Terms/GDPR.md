### **GDPR**

**[[GDPR]]** is a set of rules and regulations developed by the European Union (EU) that puts data owners in total control of their personal information. Under GDPR, types of personal information include a person's name, address, phone number, financial information, and medical information.

The GDPR applies to any business that handles the data of EU citizens or residents, regardless of where that business operates. For example, a US based company that handles the data of EU visitors to their website is subject to the GDPRs provisions.
