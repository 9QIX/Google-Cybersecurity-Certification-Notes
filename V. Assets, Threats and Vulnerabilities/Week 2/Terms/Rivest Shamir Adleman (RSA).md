Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA)]]_ is named after its three creators who developed it while at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). RSA is one of the first asymmetric encryption algorithms that produces a public and private key pair. Asymmetric algorithms like RSA produce even longer key lengths. In part, this is due to the fact that these functions are creating two keys. RSA key sizes are 1,024, 2,048, or 4,096 bits. RSA is mainly used to protect highly sensitive data.
