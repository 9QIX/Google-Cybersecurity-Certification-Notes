- **[[Sessions]]:** When a user accesses a system, they initiate a session, which is a sequence of network requests and responses associated with the same user. Access logs essentially record these sessions.
	- **[[Session ID]]:** At the beginning of a session, a unique token known as a session ID is created to identify the user and their device while accessing the system. Session IDs remain attached to the user until they close their browser or the session times out.
	- **[[Session Cookies]]:** Another action that occurs at the start of a session is the exchange of session cookies between the server and the user's device. Session cookies are tokens used to validate a session and determine its duration. They make web sessions more secure and efficient.
