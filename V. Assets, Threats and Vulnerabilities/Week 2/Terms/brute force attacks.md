## The importance of key length

Ciphers are vulnerable to **[[brute force attacks]]**, which use a trial and error process to discover private information. This tactic is the digital equivalent of trying every number in a combination lock trying to find the right one. In modern encryption, longer key lengths are considered to be more secure. Longer key lengths mean more possibilities that an attacker needs to try to unlock a cipher.

One drawback to having long encryption keys is slower processing times. Although short key lengths are generally less secure, they’re much faster to compute. Providing fast data communication online while keeping information safe is a delicate balancing act.
