The **[[data lifecycle]]** is an important model that security teams consider when protecting information. It influences how they set policies that align with business objectives. It also plays an important role in the technologies security teams use to make information accessible.

In general, the data lifecycle has five stages. Each describe how data flows through an organization from the moment it is created until it is no longer useful:

- **[[Collect]]:** This stage involves gathering data from various sources or generating it within the organization, such as through customer interactions, sensors, or user inputs.
- **[[Store]]:** Data is stored securely, typically in databases or file systems, to ensure accessibility and preservation. Proper storage mechanisms and access controls are crucial during this phase.
- **[[Use]]:** Data is actively employed for various purposes, including analysis, decision-making, reporting, or other business operations. This stage often involves processing and manipulating data.
- **[[Archive]]:** Data that is no longer in active use but still holds value for compliance, historical analysis, or reference purposes is archived. It is moved to long-term storage, which may involve different retention policies.
- **[[Destroy]]:** At this final stage, data that is no longer needed or has reached the end of its retention period is permanently removed to reduce risk and ensure compliance with data protection regulations. Secure data destruction methods are applied to prevent unauthorized recovery.
