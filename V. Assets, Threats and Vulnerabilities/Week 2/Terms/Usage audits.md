### **[[Usage audits]]**

When conducting a usage audit, the security team will review which resources each account is accessing and what the user is doing with the resource. Usage audits can help determine whether users are acting in accordance with an organizationâ€™s security policies. They can also help identify whether a user has permissions that can be revoked because they are no longer being used.
