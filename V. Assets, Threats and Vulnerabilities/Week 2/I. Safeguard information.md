# Security controls

- **Security Controls:** Organizations face the challenge of safeguarding information in a data-rich environment. Security controls are essential for mitigating specific security risks and are employed before, during, and after security incidents.

- **Types of Security Controls:***
	- **Technical Controls:** These encompass various technologies (e.g., encryption,  authentication systems) to protect assets.
	- **Operational Controls:** Day-to-day security management activities, including awareness training and incident response, typically carried out by individuals.
	- **Managerial Controls:** Policies, standards, and procedures guide security efforts, with the organization's security policy outlining necessary controls.

- **Information Privacy:** Protecting data from unauthorized access and distribution is central to information privacy. Individuals and organizations have the right to control the sharing of their private information.

- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Security controls aim to limit access based on the user and situation, adhering to the principle of least privilege. Access should be granted only as needed for specific roles or tasks.

- **Data Owners and Custodians:** Distinguishing between data owners (who control data access) and data custodians (entities responsible for secure data handling, transport, and storage) is crucial in security controls.

- **Data Classification:** Data is treated as an asset and requires proper classification and handling, similar to other assets, to ensure security.

The course highlights the significance of security controls in information protection, respecting privacy, and following the principle of least privilege. It also emphasizes the roles of data owners and custodians and the importance of data classification and handling practices. Subsequent sections of the course will delve deeper into security controls.
