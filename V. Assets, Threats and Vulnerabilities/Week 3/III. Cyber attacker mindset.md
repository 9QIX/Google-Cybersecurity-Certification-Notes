# Protect all entry points

- **Attack Surface:** An attack surface refers to all the potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit. Analyzing the attack surface is often the first step taken by security teams in enhancing an organization's defenses.
	- **Castle Analogy:** The video provides an analogy by comparing the role of a security team at an old castle. The team must allocate resources to defend the castle effectively. While the castle's giant walls, stone towers, and wooden gates are common security controls, they might not cover all possible attack scenarios. For instance, if the castle is located near the ocean, it could be vulnerable to attacks by ships. In this case, the security team should equip the castle with catapults to address this specific threat.
- **Modern Organizations:** Modern organizations need to consider both physical and digital attack surfaces. The physical attack surface includes people and their devices, which can be targeted from both inside and outside the organization. For example, an unattended laptop in a public space can be vulnerable to external threats, such as competitors or internal threats, like disgruntled employees. Security hardening is the process of strengthening a system to reduce its vulnerabilities and attack surface, often accomplished by placing obstacles to deter attacks.
- **Security Hardening:** The video emphasizes the importance of security hardening in minimizing the physical attack surface. Security hardening involves reducing vulnerabilities and limiting points of entry. Elements like organizational policies and access controls are common ways organizations use to harden their physical attack surface.
- **Digital Attack Surface:** The digital attack surface encompasses all the elements beyond an organization's firewall, including everything that connects to the organization online. Unlike the physical attack surface, hardening the digital attack surface can be more challenging.
- **Impact of Cloud Computing:** With the advent of cloud computing, organizations store their data in distributed locations, often outside their premises. This expansion of the digital attack surface allows information to be accessed from anywhere in the world, which offers greater convenience but also exposes organizations to threats from various entry points.
- **Challenges Ahead:** The video hints at exploring why securing the expanded digital attack surface is a significant challenge, which may be addressed in the next part of the discussion.

Understanding the concept of an attack surface is essential for security teams as they must identify potential vulnerabilities and prioritize their efforts in reducing risks effectively. It helps them allocate resources and focus on strengthening the weakest points in their defenses.
