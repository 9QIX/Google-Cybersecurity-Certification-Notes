# Vulnerability management

- **[[Vulnerability]]:** Vulnerabilities are weaknesses that can be exploited by potential threats. The term "can" is crucial in this context, indicating the potential for exploitation.
	- **Protecting Assets:** Protecting assets involves recognizing their vulnerabilities and addressing them. Just like protecting an important document by locking it up, vulnerabilities and potential threats must be considered, and appropriate safeguards put in place.
- **[[Exploits]]:** Exploits are the means by which vulnerabilities are taken advantage of. To plan for security effectively, understanding vulnerabilities and their potential exploits is essential.
	- **Burglar Analogy:** An analogy with home security is used to illustrate the concept. Homes have vulnerable systems like windows that can be exploited by burglars. By anticipating these vulnerabilities and exploits, one can take proactive measures, such as installing an alarm system.
- **[[Vulnerability Management]]:** Security teams engage in vulnerability management, a process that includes finding and patching vulnerabilities. It's a method for preventing threats from becoming actual problems.
	- **Four Steps of Vulnerability Management:** The vulnerability management process comprises four steps: 
		- Identifying vulnerabilities 
		- Considering potential exploits
		- Preparing defenses against threats
		- Evaluating the effectiveness of these defenses.
	- **Continuous Cycle:** Vulnerability management is an ongoing, cyclical process because new vulnerabilities constantly emerge. Security teams must remain vigilant and regularly update their defenses.
- **Zero-Day Exploits:** Zero-day exploits refer to vulnerabilities and exploits that are previously unknown. These pose significant risks as they represent unanticipated threats for which there is "zero" time to prepare. 
- **Importance of Identifying Vulnerabilities:** The most crucial step in vulnerability management is identifying vulnerabilities, as it is the foundation for developing effective security measures.

Overall, the video emphasizes the importance of understanding vulnerabilities, anticipating potential exploits, and proactively addressing security weaknesses to protect assets effectively.
