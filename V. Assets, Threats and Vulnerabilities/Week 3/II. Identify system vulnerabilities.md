# Vulnerability assessments

- **[[Vulnerability Assessment]]:** A vulnerability assessment is an internal review process conducted by an organization's security team to identify, evaluate, score, and fix vulnerabilities within their systems. It is similar to the process of identifying and categorizing vulnerabilities in the CVE list but is conducted within the organization.
	- **Role of Security Analysts:** Security analysts play a significant role in the vulnerability assessment process. They are responsible for performing the assessment, evaluating vulnerabilities, assigning risk scores, and participating in the remediation process.
	- **Goals of Vulnerability Assessment:** The primary goals of a vulnerability assessment are to identify weaknesses, prevent potential attacks, and ensure that the organization's security controls meet regulatory standards. It helps organizations proactively address vulnerabilities.
- **Selecting Focus Areas:** Given the multitude of assets that organizations need to protect, security teams may need to prioritize specific areas for assessment. They determine where to focus their vulnerability assessment efforts.
	- **Four-Step Process:** Vulnerability assessments generally follow a four-step process:
		1. **Identification:** In this step, scanning tools and manual testing are used to discover vulnerabilities. The goal is to gain an understanding of the current state of the security system.
		2. **Vulnerability Analysis:** Each identified vulnerability is tested to determine the source of the problem. This step is like being a digital detective.
		3. **Risk Assessment:** Vulnerabilities are assigned scores based on the severity of their potential impact and the likelihood of exploitation. Risk assessments help prioritize resources for addressing vulnerabilities.
		4. **Remediation:** This step involves addressing vulnerabilities based on their severity scores. It is a collaborative effort between security staff and IT teams to devise effective solutions, which may include enforcing new security procedures, updating systems, or implementing patches.

- **Search for Problems Before They Happen:** Vulnerability assessments are proactive measures that help organizations find and address security flaws before they can be exploited by threats. By conducting these assessments, companies take preventive action to enhance their security posture.

- **Future Exploration:** In the next session, the video hints at exploring how organizations decide where to focus their vulnerability assessment efforts. This likely involves considerations of critical assets and potential risks.

The video underscores the importance of conducting vulnerability assessments as a fundamental part of an organization's cybersecurity strategy. It allows organizations to stay ahead of potential threats by identifying and addressing vulnerabilities proactively.
