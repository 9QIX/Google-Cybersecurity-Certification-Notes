An automatic deployment strategy takes the opposite approach. With this option, finding, downloading, and installing updates can be done by the system or application.

**Pro tip:** The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recommends using automatic options whenever theyâ€™re available.

Certain permissions need to be enabled by users or IT groups before updates can be installed, or pushed, when they're available. It is up to the developers to adequately test their patches before release.

**Advantage:** An advantage to automatic updates is that the deployment process is simplified. It also keeps systems and software current with the latest, critical patches.

**Disadvantage:** A drawback to automatic updates is that instability issues can occur if the patches were not thoroughly tested by the vendor. This can result in performance problems and a poor user experience.
