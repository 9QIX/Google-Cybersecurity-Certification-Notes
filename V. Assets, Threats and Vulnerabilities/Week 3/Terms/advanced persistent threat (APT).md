## Advanced persistent threats

Many malicious hackers find their way into a system, cause trouble, and then leave. But on some occasions, threat actors stick around. These kinds of events are known as advanced persistent threats, or APTs.

An **[[advanced persistent threat (APT)]]** refers to instances when a threat actor maintains unauthorized access to a system for an extended period of time. The term is mostly associated with nation states and state-sponsored actors. Typically, an APT is concerned with surveilling a target to gather information. They then use the intel to manipulate government, defense, financial, and telecom services.

Just because the term is associated with state actors does not mean that private businesses are safe from APTs. These kinds of threat actors are stealthy because hacking into another government agency or utility is costly and time consuming. APTs will often target private organizations first as a step towards gaining access to larger entities.
