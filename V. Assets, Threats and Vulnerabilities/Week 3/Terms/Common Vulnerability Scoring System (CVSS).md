**Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS):** The **[[NIST National Vulnerabilities Database]]** uses the **[[Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)]]** to score the severity of vulnerabilities. CVSS is a measurement system that calculates the impact and urgency of addressing a vulnerability. Scores range from 0 to 10, with lower scores considered low risk and higher scores indicating critical risk.
