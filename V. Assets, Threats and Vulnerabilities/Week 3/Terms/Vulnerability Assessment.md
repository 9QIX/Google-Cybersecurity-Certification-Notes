# Approaches to vulnerability scanning

Previously, you learned about a **[[vulnerability assessment]]**, which is the internal review process of an organization's security systems. An organization performs vulnerability assessments to identify weaknesses and prevent attacks. Vulnerability scanning tools are commonly used to simulate threats by finding vulnerabilities in an attack surface. They also help security teams take proactive steps towards implementing their remediation strategy.

Vulnerability scanners are important tools that you'll likely use in the field. In this reading, youâ€™ll explore how vulnerability scanners work and the types of scans they can perform.
