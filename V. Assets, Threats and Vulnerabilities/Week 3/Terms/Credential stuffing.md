_[[Credential stuffing]]_ is a tactic in which attackers use stolen login credentials from previous data breaches to access user accounts at another organization. A specialized type of credential stuffing is called _pass the hash_. These attacks reuse stolen, unsalted hashed credentials to trick an authentication system into creating a new authenticated user session on the network.
