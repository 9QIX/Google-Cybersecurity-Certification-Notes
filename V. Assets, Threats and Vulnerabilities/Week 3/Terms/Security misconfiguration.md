### **[[Security misconfiguration]]**

Misconfigurations occur when security settings aren’t properly set or maintained. Companies use a variety of different interconnected systems. Mistakes often happen when those systems aren’t properly set up or audited. A common example is when businesses deploy equipment, like a network server, using default settings. This can lead businesses to use settings that fail to address the organization's security objectives.
