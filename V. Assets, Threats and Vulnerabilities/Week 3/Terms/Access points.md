## [[Access points]]

Each threat actor has a unique motivation for targeting an organization's assets. Keeping them out takes more than knowing their intentions and capabilities. It’s also important to recognize the types of attack vectors they’ll use.

For the most part, threat actors gain access through one of these attack vector categories:

- **[[Direct access]]**, referring to instances when they have physical access to a system
- **[[Removable media]]**, which includes portable hardware, like USB flash drives
- **[[Social media platforms]]** that are used for communication and content sharing
- **[[Email]]**, including both personal and business accounts
- **[[Wireless networks]]** on premises
- **[[Cloud services]]** usually provided by third-party organizations
- **[[Supply chains]]** like third-party vendors that can present a backdoor into systems

Any of these attack vectors can provide access to a system. Recognizing a threat actor’s intentions can help you determine which access points they might target and what ultimate goals they could have. For example, remote workers are more likely to present a threat via email than a direct access threat.

## Key takeaways

Defending an attack surface starts with thinking like a threat actor. As a security professional, it’s important to understand _why_ someone would pose a threat to organizational assets. This includes recognizing that every threat actor isn’t intentionally out to cause harm.

It’s equally important to recognize the ways in which a threat actor might gain access to a system. Matching intentions with attack vectors is an invaluable skill as you continue to develop an attacker mindset.

# Pathways through defenses

- **Expanding Attack Surface:** The video highlights how cloud computing has expanded the digital attack surface for organizations. With more data stored in the cloud and accessible from various locations, there are an increased number of attack vectors that malicious actors can exploit.
- **Attack Vectors Defined:** Attack vectors are the pathways that attackers use to penetrate security defenses. They are akin to the doors and windows of a home, representing the exploitable features of the attack surface. Examples of attack vectors include social media platforms and removable media like USB drives.
- **Internal and External Threats:** The video notes that not only malicious hackers but also employees can exploit attack vectors, whether intentionally or unintentionally. This includes sharing sensitive company information on social media platforms, which can harm an organization.
- **Securing Against Attack Vectors:** Security teams treat attack vectors as critical risks to asset security and must put significant effort into stopping them. This involves thinking with an attacker's mindset and asking questions such as "How would we exploit this vector?" A step-by-step process is employed to answer this question.
- **Steps in Attacker Mindset:** The steps in adopting an attacker mindset include: identifying the target (e.g., specific information, a system, a person, or the organization itself), determining how the target can be accessed, evaluating the attack vectors that can be exploited to gain entry, and finding the tools and methods of attack.
- **Educating Users:** Educating users about security vulnerabilities, particularly those tied to specific events like new phishing exploits, is one way to defend against attack vectors.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Applying the principle of least privilege, which restricts access rights to what's required to perform a task, helps close security holes within an organization's attack surface.
- **Using Security Controls and Tools:** The right security controls and tools, such as antivirus software, can be instrumental in defending against attack vectors, reducing the risk of human error.
- **Building a Diverse Security Team:** Building a diverse security team with varied perspectives is crucial for reducing the risk of attack vectors and preventing future attacks. Diverse perspectives enhance the team's ability to apply an attacker's mindset and stay ahead of potential threats.
- **Stay Informed:** The video encourages individuals in the field of cybersecurity to keep themselves informed as staying updated is important in this domain.

Understanding attack vectors and adopting an attacker mindset are fundamental for organizations to effectively protect against a wide range of threats in the digital landscape. This approach helps identify vulnerabilities, develop security controls, and prioritize resources for defense.
