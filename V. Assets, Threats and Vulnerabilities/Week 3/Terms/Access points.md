## [[Access points]]

Each threat actor has a unique motivation for targeting an organization's assets. Keeping them out takes more than knowing their intentions and capabilities. It’s also important to recognize the types of attack vectors they’ll use.

For the most part, threat actors gain access through one of these attack vector categories:

- **[[Direct access]]**, referring to instances when they have physical access to a system
- **[[Removable media]]**, which includes portable hardware, like USB flash drives
- **[[Social media platforms]]** that are used for communication and content sharing
- **[[Email]]**, including both personal and business accounts
- **[[Wireless networks]]** on premises
- **[[Cloud services]]** usually provided by third-party organizations
- **[[Supply chains]]** like third-party vendors that can present a backdoor into systems

Any of these attack vectors can provide access to a system. Recognizing a threat actor’s intentions can help you determine which access points they might target and what ultimate goals they could have. For example, remote workers are more likely to present a threat via email than a direct access threat.
