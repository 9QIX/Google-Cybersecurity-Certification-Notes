_[[Unauthenticated scans]]_ simulate external threat actors that do not have access to your business resources. For example, a scan might analyze file shares within the organization that are used to house internal-only documents. Unauthenticated users should receive "access denied" results if they tried opening these files. However, a vulnerability would be identified if you were able to access a file.
