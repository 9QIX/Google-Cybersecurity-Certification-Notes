A manual deployment strategy relies on IT departments or users obtaining updates from the developers. Home office or small business environments might require you to find, download, and install updates yourself. In enterprise settings, the process is usually handled with a configuration management tool. These tools offer a range of options to deploy updates, like to all clients on your network or a select group of users.  

**Advantage:** An advantage of manual update deployment strategies is control. That can be useful if software updates are not thoroughly tested by developers, leading to instability issues.

**Disadvantage:** A drawback to manual update deployments is that critical updates can be forgotten or disregarded entirely.
