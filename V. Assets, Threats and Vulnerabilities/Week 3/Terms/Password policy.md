### **[[Password policy]]**

Organizations use these managerial controls to standardize good password practices across their business. For example, one of these policies might require users to create passwords that are at least 8 characters long and feature a letter, number, and symbol. Other common requirements can include password lockout policies. For example, a password lockout can limit the number of login attempts before access to an account is suspended and require users to create new, unique passwords after a certain amount of time.

The purpose of each of these requirements is to create more possible password combinations. This lengthens the amount of time it takes an attacker to find one that will work. The [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-63B](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63b.pdf) provides detailed guidance that organizations can reference when creating their own password policies.
