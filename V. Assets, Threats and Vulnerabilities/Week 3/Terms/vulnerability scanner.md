## What is a vulnerability scanner?

A **[[vulnerability scanner]]** is software that automatically compares known vulnerabilities and exposures against the technologies on the network. In general, these tools scan systems to find misconfigurations or programming flaws.

Scanning tools are used to analyze each of the five attack surfaces that you learned about in [the video about the defense in depth strategy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/assets-threats-and-vulnerabilities/lecture/IdvXj/defense-in-depth-strategy):

1. **Perimeter layer**, like authentication systems that validate user access
2. **Network layer**, which is made up of technologies like network firewalls and others
3. **Endpoint layer**, which describes devices on a network, like laptops, desktops, or servers
4. **Application layer**, which involves the software that users interact with
5. **Data layer**, which includes any information thatâ€™s stored, in transit, or in use

When a scan of any layer begins, the scanning tool compares the findings against databases of security threats. At the end of the scan, the tool flags any vulnerabilities that it finds and adds them to its reference database. Each scan adds more information to the database, helping the tool be more accurate in its analysis.

**Note:** Vulnerability databases are also routinely updated by the company that designed the scanning software.
