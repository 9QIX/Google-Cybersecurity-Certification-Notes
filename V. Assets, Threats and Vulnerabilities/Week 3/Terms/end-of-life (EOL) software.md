Sometimes updates are not available for a certain type of software known as **[[end-of-life (EOL) software]]**. All software has a lifecycle. It begins when it’s produced and ends when a newer version is released. At that point, developers must allocate resources to the newer versions, which leads to EOL software. While the older software is still useful, the manufacturer no longer supports it. 

**Note:** Patches and updates are very different from upgrades. _Upgrades_ refer to completely new versions of hardware or software that can be purchased.

[CISA recommends discontinuing the use of EOL software](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/understanding-patches-and-software-updates)

because it poses an unfixable risk to systems. But, this recommendation is not always followed. Replacing EOL technology can be costly for businesses and individual users.

The risks that EOL software presents continues to grow as more connected devices enter the marketplace. For example, there are billions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, like smart light bulbs, connected to home and work networks. In some business settings, all an attacker needs is a single unpatched device to gain access to the network and cause problems.
