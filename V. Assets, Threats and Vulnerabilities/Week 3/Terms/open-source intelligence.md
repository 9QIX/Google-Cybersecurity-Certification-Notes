Cyber attacks can sometimes be prevented with the right information, which starts with knowing where your systems are vulnerable. Previously, you learned that the CVE® list and scanning tools are two useful ways of finding weaknesses. But, there are other ways to identify vulnerabilities and threats.

In this reading, you’ll learn about **[[open-source intelligence]]**, commonly known as OSINT. OSINT is the collection and analysis of information from publicly available sources to generate usable intelligence. It's commonly used to support cybersecurity activities, like identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities. You'll learn why open-source intelligence is gathered and how it can improve cybersecurity. You’ll also learn about commonly used resources and tools for gathering information and intelligence.
