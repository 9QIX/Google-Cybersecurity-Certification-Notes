# Elements of a security plan

**Security as a Culture**
- Security is not solely the responsibility of a single person or a specific department; it's a shared set of values that permeates all levels of an organization.
- This security culture extends to employees, vendors, customers, and all stakeholders.

**Importance of a Team Effort**
- Protecting digital and physical assets requires collective participation, involving everyone within an organization.
- Emphasizing people as a central focus leads to more effective security plans that consider diverse backgrounds and perspectives.

### **Understanding Risk Categories and Factors**

**Risk Categories and Factors**
- **[[Risks]]** in security refer to anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset.
- Security plans often categorize risks based on various factors, such as **damage, disclosure, or loss of information**.
- Factors contributing to risks can include physical damage, device malfunctions, attacks, human errors, and more.

**Risk Mitigation Through Policies**
- **[[Policies]]** within security plans are a set of rules aimed at reducing risk and protecting information.
- Policies establish the foundation of a security plan, providing guidance to individuals both inside and outside the organization.
- They focus on the strategic aspects by defining the scope, objectives, and limitations of security measures.

**Standards as Reference Points**
- **[[Standards]]** in security serve as references to inform how policies should be implemented.
- They create a point of reference for assessing the effectiveness of security measures.
- For example, password management standards like those in **NIST Special Publication 800-63B** specify password length requirements.

**Procedures for Actionable Guidance**
- **[[Procedures]]** are step-by-step instructions for performing specific security tasks.
- Organizations maintain various procedure documents used throughout the company, such as password creation or reset procedures.
- Clear and actionable procedures promote accountability, consistency, and efficiency within the organization.

**Tailored Security Plans**
- Policies, standards, and procedures are tailored to each organization's unique goals and requirements.
- The structure and content of security plans can vary widely from one company to another.

Understanding the structure and purpose of security plans, encompassing policies, standards, and procedures, is essential for creating a collaborative and effective security culture. These components collectively contribute to safeguarding assets and mitigating risks across organizations.

# The NIST Cybersecurity Framework

**[[Compliance]]:** This involves adhering to internal standards and external regulations in the realm of security. It's essential for maintaining trust, reputation, data integrity, and avoiding legal consequences, particularly in highly regulated industries.

**[[Regulations]]:** These are rules established by government or authoritative bodies to oversee and control specific practices, typically on a larger scale to protect individuals and their information.

**[[NIST Cybersecurity Framework]]:** This framework, provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), offers standards, guidelines, and best practices for managing cybersecurity risk.

## Components of NIST CSF
- **[[The Core]]:** This core component identifies five main functions: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. It essentially serves as a security checklist.
- **[[Tiers]]:** Tiers range from Level-1 (passive) to Level-4 (adaptive) and gauge the performance of each core function, helping organizations understand their security plan's effectiveness.
- **[[Profiles]]:** Profiles act like snapshots in time, providing insights into the current state of a security plan. They are useful for tracking changes and improvements.
