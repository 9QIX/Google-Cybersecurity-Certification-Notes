# Elements of a security plan

**Security as a Culture**
- Security is not solely the responsibility of a single person or a specific department; it's a shared set of values that permeates all levels of an organization.
- This security culture extends to employees, vendors, customers, and all stakeholders.

**Importance of a Team Effort**
- Protecting digital and physical assets requires collective participation, involving everyone within an organization.
- Emphasizing people as a central focus leads to more effective security plans that consider diverse backgrounds and perspectives.

### **Understanding Risk Categories and Factors**

**Risk Categories and Factors**
- **[[Risks]]** in security refer to anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset.
- Security plans often categorize risks based on various factors, such as **damage, disclosure, or loss of information**.
- Factors contributing to risks can include physical damage, device malfunctions, attacks, human errors, and more.

**Risk Mitigation Through Policies**
- **[[Policies]]** within security plans are a set of rules aimed at reducing risk and protecting information.
- Policies establish the foundation of a security plan, providing guidance to individuals both inside and outside the organization.
- They focus on the strategic aspects by defining the scope, objectives, and limitations of security measures.

**Standards as Reference Points**
- **[[Standards]]** in security serve as references to inform how policies should be implemented.
- They create a point of reference for assessing the effectiveness of security measures.
- For example, password management standards like those in **NIST Special Publication 800-63B** specify password length requirements.

**Procedures for Actionable Guidance**
- **[[Procedures]]** are step-by-step instructions for performing specific security tasks.
- Organizations maintain various procedure documents used throughout the company, such as password creation or reset procedures.
- Clear and actionable procedures promote accountability, consistency, and efficiency within the organization.

**Tailored Security Plans**
- Policies, standards, and procedures are tailored to each organization's unique goals and requirements.
- The structure and content of security plans can vary widely from one company to another.

Understanding the structure and purpose of security plans, encompassing policies, standards, and procedures, is essential for creating a collaborative and effective security culture. These components collectively contribute to safeguarding assets and mitigating risks across organizations.

# The NIST Cybersecurity Framework

**[[Compliance]]:** This involves adhering to internal standards and external regulations in the realm of security. It's essential for maintaining trust, reputation, data integrity, and avoiding legal consequences, particularly in highly regulated industries.

**[[Regulations]]:** These are rules established by government or authoritative bodies to oversee and control specific practices, typically on a larger scale to protect individuals and their information.

**[[NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)]]:** This framework, provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), offers standards, guidelines, and best practices for managing cybersecurity risk.

## Components of NIST CSF
- **[[Core]]:** It essentially serves as a security checklist. This core component identifies five main functions: 
	- **[[Identify]]:** Understand and manage cybersecurity risks.
	- **[[Protect]]:** Implement safeguards for critical assets.
	- **[[Detect]]:** Promptly identify cybersecurity events.
	- **[[Respond]]:** Develop effective response strategies.
	- **[[Recover]]:** Restore systems and data after incidents.
- **[[Tiers]]:** Tiers range from Level-1 (passive) to Level-4 (adaptive) and gauge the performance of each core function, helping organizations understand their security plan's effectiveness.
- **[[Profiles]]:** Profiles act like snapshots in time, providing insights into the current state of a security plan. They are useful for tracking changes and improvements.

# Security guidelines in action

Organizations often face an overwhelming amount of risk. Developing a security plan from the beginning that addresses all risk can be challenging. This makes security frameworks a useful option.

Previously, you learned about the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). A major benefit of the CSF is that it's flexible and can be applied to any industry. In this reading, you’ll explore how the NIST CSF can be implemented.

## Origins of the framework

Originally released in 2014, NIST developed the Cybersecurity Framework to protect critical infrastructure in the United States. NIST was selected to develop the CSF because they are an unbiased source of scientific data and practices. NIST eventually adapted the CSF to fit the needs of businesses in the public and private sector. Their goal was to make the framework more flexible, making it easier to adopt for small businesses or anyone else that might lack the resources to develop their own security plans.

## Components of the CSF

As you might recall, the framework consists of three main components: the _core_, _tiers_, and _profiles_. In the following sections, you'll learn more about each of these CSF components.

### **[[Core]]**

The CSF core is a set of desired cybersecurity outcomes that help organizations customize their security plan. It consists of five functions, or parts: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. These functions are commonly used as an informative reference to help organizations _identify_ their most important assets and _protect_ those assets with appropriate safeguards. The CSF core is also used to understand ways to _detect_ attacks and develop _response_ and _recovery_ plans should an attack happen.

### **[[Tiers]]**

The CSF tiers are a way of measuring the sophistication of an organization's cybersecurity program. CSF tiers are measured on a scale of 1 to 4. Tier 1 is the lowest score, indicating that a limited set of security controls have been implemented. Overall, CSF tiers are used to assess an organization's security posture and identify areas for improvement.

### **[[Profiles]]**

The CSF profiles are pre-made templates of the NIST CSF that are developed by a team of industry experts. CSF profiles are tailored to address the specific risks of an organization or industry. They are used to help organizations develop a baseline for their cybersecurity plans, or as a way of comparing their current cybersecurity posture to a specific industry standard.

**Note:** The core, tiers, and profiles were each designed to help any business improve their security operations. Although there are only three components, the entire framework consists of a complex system of subcategories and processes.

## Implementing the CSF

As you might recall, compliance is an important concept in security. **Compliance** is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations. In other words, compliance is a way of measuring how well an organization is protecting their assets. The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** is a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. Organizations may choose to use the CSF to achieve compliance with a variety of regulations.

**Note:** Regulations are rules that _must_ be followed, while frameworks are resources you can _choose_ to use.

Since its creation, many businesses have used the NIST CSF. However, CSF can be a challenge to implement due to its high level of detail. It can also be tough to find where the framework fits in. For example, some businesses have established security plans, making it unclear how CSF can benefit them. Alternatively, some businesses might be in the early stages of building their plans and need a place to start.

In any scenario, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) provides detailed guidance that any organization can use to implement the CSF. This is a quick overview and summary of their recommendations:

- **Create a current profile** of the security operations and outline the specific needs of your business.
- **Perform a risk assessment** to identify which of your current operations are meeting business and regulatory standards.
- **Analyze and prioritize existing gaps** in security operations that place the businesses assets at risk.
- **Implement a plan of action** to achieve your organization’s goals and objectives.

**Pro tip:** Always consider current risk, threat, and vulnerability trends when using the NIST CSF. 

You can learn more about implementing the CSF in [this report by CISA that outlines how the framework was applied in the commercial facilities sector](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Commercial_Facilities_Sector_Cybersecurity_Framework_Implementation_Guidance_FINAL_508.pdf).

## Industries embracing the CSF

The NIST CSF has continued to evolve since its introduction in 2014. Its design is influenced by the standards and best practices of some of the largest companies in the world.

A benefit of the framework is that it aligns with the security practices of many organizations across the global economy. It also helps with regulatory compliance that might be shared by business partners.

## Key takeaways

The NIST CSF is a flexible resource that organizations may choose to use to assess and improve their security posture. It's a useful framework that combines the security best practices of industries around the world. Implementing the CSF can be a challenge for any organization. The CSF can help business meet regulatory compliance requirements to avoid financial and reputational risks.
