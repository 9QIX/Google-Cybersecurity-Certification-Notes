# The what, why, and how of asset security

**Dealing with Uncertainty**
- We all tackle uncertainties by proactively solving problems before they manifest. For instance, when going on a trip, we plan based on factors like trip duration and climate.
- Organizations, akin to individuals, plan ahead by assessing risks to establish a sense of security in the face of potential issues.

**Understanding Risk in Security**
- Security teams play a crucial role in addressing risks. In security, **[[risk]]** encompasses anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset.
- The core focus of security practitioners is to uphold the three pillars of the CIA triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
- Security risk planning serves as the initial step in safeguarding these foundational principles.

**Tailored Security Plans**
- Each organization devises a unique security plan tailored to the specific risks they encounter. As a security practitioner, you don't need to memorize all possible plans but should grasp the fundamentals of their construction.

**Elements of Security Plans**
- **[[Security plans]]** are founded on the analysis of three key components: **assets, threats, and vulnerabilities**.
- Organizations assess security risks by examining how each of these elements can impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their information and systems.
	**[[Assets]]: Valuable Items**
	- Assets represent items perceived as valuable to an organization, encompassing a wide array of entities, such as buildings, equipment, data, and personnel.
	- Prioritization is essential as different assets require varying levels of protection based on their vulnerability to threats.
	
	**[[Threats]]: Impacting Security**
	- Threats encompass any circumstances or events that can negatively affect assets. They come in various forms and can include external threats like burglars or even accidental events.
	- Identifying threats demonstrates a security-oriented mindset.
	
	**[[Vulnerabilities]]: Weaknesses to Address**
	- Vulnerabilities denote weaknesses within assets that can be exploited by threats. For instance, a weak lock on a front door is a vulnerability a burglar can exploit.
	- Security teams must consider a diverse range of vulnerabilities when planning for the future.

# Understand risks, threats, and vulnerabilities

When security events occur, you’ll need to work in close coordination with others to address the problem. Doing so quickly requires clear communication between you and your team to get the job done.

Previously, you learned about three foundational security terms:

- **[[Risk]]**: Anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset
- **[[Threat]]**: Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets
- **[[Vulnerability]]**: A weakness that can be exploited by a threat

These words tend to be used interchangeably in everyday life. But in security, they are used to describe very specific concepts when responding to and planning for security events. In this reading, you’ll identify what each term represents and how they are related.

## Security risk

Security plans are all about how an organization defines risk. However, this definition can vary widely by organization. As you may recall, a **[[risk]]** is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. Since organizations have particular assets that they value, they tend to differ in how they interpret and approach risk.

One way to interpret risk is to consider the potential effects that negative events can have on a business. Another way to present this idea is with this calculation:

**Likelihood x Impact = Risk**

For example, you risk being late when you drive a car to work. This negative event is more likely to happen if you get a flat tire along the way. And the impact could be serious, like losing your job. All these factors influence how you approach commuting to work every day. The same is true for how businesses handle security risks.

In general, we calculate risk in this field to help:

- Prevent costly and disruptive events
- Identify improvements that can be made to systems and processes
- Determine which risks can be tolerated
- Prioritize the critical assets that require attention

The business impact of a negative event will always depend on the asset and the situation. Your primary focus as a security professional will be to focus on the likelihood side of the equation by dealing with certain factors that increase the odds of a problem.

## Risk factors

As you’ll discover throughout this course, there are two broad risk factors that you’ll be concerned with in the field:

- Threats
- Vulnerabilities

The risk of an asset being harmed or damaged depends greatly on whether a threat takes advantage of vulnerabilities.

Let’s apply this to the risk of being late to work. A threat would be a nail puncturing your tire, since tires are vulnerable to running over sharp objects. In terms of security planning, you would want to reduce the likelihood of this risk by driving on a clean road.

### **Categories of threat**

**[[Threats]]** are circumstances or events that can negatively impact assets. There are many different types of threats. However, they are commonly categorized as two types: **intentional** and **unintentional**.

For example, an _intentional_ threat might be a malicious hacker who gains access to sensitive information by targeting a misconfigured application. An _unintentional_ threat might be an employee who holds the door open for an unknown person and grants them access to a restricted area. Either one can cause an event that must be responded to.

### **Categories of vulnerability**

**[[Vulnerabilities]]** are weaknesses that can be exploited by threats. There’s a wide range of vulnerabilities, but they can be grouped into two categories: **technical** and **human**.

For example, a _technical_ vulnerability can be misconfigured software that might give an unauthorized person access to important data. A _human_ vulnerability can be a forgetful employee who loses their access card in a parking lot. Either one can lead to risk.

## Key takeaways

Risks, threats, and vulnerabilities have very specific meanings in security. Knowing the relationship between them can help you build a strong foundation as you grow essential skills and knowledge as a security analyst. This can help you gain credibility in the industry by demonstrating that you have working knowledge of the field. And it signals to your future colleagues that you’re a member of the global security community.

In this section, we explored the crucial concept of asset management in the realm of security planning. Here's a structured summary of the key concepts covered:

# Security starts with asset classification

**Analogies to Everyday Life**
- Everyone has experienced the stress of misplacing something important, like keys or a phone. Similarly, organizations face challenges related to safeguarding their valuable assets.

**Scenario: Joining a Security Team**
- Imagine joining the security team of a growing online retailer tasked with protecting numerous assets as the company expands. Each team member is responsible for safeguarding ten assets, highlighting the significance of asset management.

**The Role of Asset Management**
- **[[Asset management]]** is the process of tracking assets and assessing the associated risks. It forms the foundation of all security plans.
- Assets encompass a wide array of items perceived as valuable to an organization, including equipment, data, and intellectual property.

**Importance of Asset Inventory**
- Asset management commences with the creation of an **[[asset inventory]]**, a comprehensive catalog of assets requiring protection.
- An accurate asset inventory is pivotal in preventing the loss or misplacement of valuable assets and enables efficient resource allocation.
- It serves as a proactive tool, providing alerts if assets go missing, similar to a shepherd tracking their sheep.

**Asset Classification**
- **[[Asset classification]]** is the practice of categorizing assets based on their sensitivity and importance to an organization.
- Many organizations adopt a basic classification scheme, which typically includes the following categories:
	- **[[Public]]**: Assets that can be shared with anyone.
	- **[[Internal-Only]]**: Assets shareable within the organization but not externally.
	- **[[Confidential]]**: Assets restricted to specific project teams.
	- **[[Restricted]]**: Highly sensitive assets, considered "need-to-know," such as intellectual property or sensitive personal data.
- Classification governs whether an asset can be disclosed, altered, or destroyed, providing clear guidelines for asset handling.

**Continuous Asset Management**
- Asset management is an ongoing process that helps identify potential security gaps and risks.
- It ensures that all assets vital to an organization are well-tracked and protected, forming an integral part of security planning.

By embracing the principles of asset management, organizations can proactively secure their valuable assets, mitigate risks, and maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical information and systems.
