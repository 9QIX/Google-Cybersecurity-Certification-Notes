# The what, why, and how of asset security

**Dealing with Uncertainty**
- We all tackle uncertainties by proactively solving problems before they manifest. For instance, when going on a trip, we plan based on factors like trip duration and climate.
- Organizations, akin to individuals, plan ahead by assessing risks to establish a sense of security in the face of potential issues.

**Understanding [[Risk]] in Security**
- Security teams play a crucial role in addressing risks. In security, risk encompasses anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset.
- The core focus of security practitioners is to uphold the three pillars of the CIA triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
- Security risk planning serves as the initial step in safeguarding these foundational principles.

**Tailored Security Plans**
- Each organization devises a unique security plan tailored to the specific risks they encounter. As a security practitioner, you don't need to memorize all possible plans but should grasp the fundamentals of their construction.

**Elements of Security Plans**
- Security plans are founded on the analysis of three key components: assets, threats, and vulnerabilities.
- Organizations assess security risks by examining how each of these elements can impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their information and systems.

**Assets: Valuable Items**
- Assets represent items perceived as valuable to an organization, encompassing a wide array of entities, such as buildings, equipment, data, and personnel.
- Prioritization is essential as different assets require varying levels of protection based on their vulnerability to threats.

**Threats: Impacting Security**
- Threats encompass any circumstances or events that can negatively affect assets. They come in various forms and can include external threats like burglars or even accidental events.
- Identifying threats demonstrates a security-oriented mindset.

**Vulnerabilities: Weaknesses to Address**
- Vulnerabilities denote weaknesses within assets that can be exploited by threats. For instance, a weak lock on a front door is a vulnerability a burglar can exploit.
- Security teams must consider a diverse range of vulnerabilities when planning for the future.

While we will delve deeper into various threat types and vulnerabilities later, it's crucial to comprehend that security teams must account for a broad spectrum of assets, threats, and vulnerabilities to effectively strategize for the future. This holistic approach ensures organizations are well-prepared to mitigate potential security risks.
