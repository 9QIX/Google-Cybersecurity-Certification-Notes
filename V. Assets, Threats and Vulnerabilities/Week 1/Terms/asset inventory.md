**Importance of Asset Inventory**
- Asset management commences with the creation of an **[[asset inventory]]**, a comprehensive catalog of assets requiring protection.
- An accurate asset inventory is pivotal in preventing the loss or misplacement of valuable assets and enables efficient resource allocation.
- It serves as a proactive tool, providing alerts if assets go missing, similar to a shepherd tracking their sheep.
