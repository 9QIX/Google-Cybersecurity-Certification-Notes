**Elements of Security Plans**
- **[[Security plans]]** are founded on the analysis of three key components: **assets, threats, and vulnerabilities**.
- Organizations assess security risks by examining how each of these elements can impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their information and systems.
	**[[Assets]]: Valuable Items**
	- Assets represent items perceived as valuable to an organization, encompassing a wide array of entities, such as buildings, equipment, data, and personnel.
	- Prioritization is essential as different assets require varying levels of protection based on their vulnerability to threats.
	
	**[[Threats]]: Impacting Security**
	- Threats encompass any circumstances or events that can negatively affect assets. They come in various forms and can include external threats like burglars or even accidental events.
	- Identifying threats demonstrates a security-oriented mindset.
	
	**[[Vulnerabilities]]: Weaknesses to Address**
	- Vulnerabilities denote weaknesses within assets that can be exploited by threats. For instance, a weak lock on a front door is a vulnerability a burglar can exploit.
	- Security teams must consider a diverse range of vulnerabilities when planning for the future.
