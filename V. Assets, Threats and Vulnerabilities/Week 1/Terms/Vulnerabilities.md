**[[Vulnerabilities]]: Weaknesses to Address**
	- Vulnerabilities denote weaknesses within assets that can be exploited by threats. For instance, a weak lock on a front door is a vulnerability a burglar can exploit.
	- Security teams must consider a diverse range of vulnerabilities when planning for the future.

### **Categories of vulnerability**

**[[Vulnerabilities]]** are weaknesses that can be exploited by threats. Thereâ€™s a wide range of vulnerabilities, but they can be grouped into two categories: technical and human.

For example, a _technical_ vulnerability can be misconfigured software that might give an unauthorized person access to important data. A _human_ vulnerability can be a forgetful employee who loses their access card in a parking lot. Either one can lead to risk.

**[[Vulnerabilities]]** are weaknesses within a system, while exposures are mistakes that can be exploited by threats.
