**Asset Classification**
- **[[Asset classification]]** is the practice of categorizing assets based on their sensitivity and importance to an organization.
- Many organizations adopt a basic classification scheme, which typically includes the following categories:
	- **[[Public]]**: Assets that can be shared with anyone.
	- **[[Internal-Only]]**: Assets shareable within the organization but not externally.
	- **[[Confidential]]**: Assets restricted to specific project teams.
	- **[[Restricted]]**: Highly sensitive assets, considered "need-to-know," such as intellectual property or sensitive personal data.
- Classification governs whether an asset can be disclosed, altered, or destroyed, providing clear guidelines for asset handling.
