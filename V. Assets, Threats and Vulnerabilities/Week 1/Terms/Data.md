**Data in the Digital Age**
- In today's connected world, valuable assets are often associated with information, which is primarily in digital form.
- **[[Data]]** refers to information that is processed, stored, or transmitted by computers and electronic devices.

**States of Data and Information Security**
- [[Information security (InfoSec)]] is the practice of safeguarding data in all its states from unauthorized access.
- Security teams focus on protecting data in three primary states:
  1. **[[Data in Use]]**: Data actively being accessed by one or more users, such as reading an email or working on a document.
  2. **[[Data in Transit]]**: Data in the process of moving from one point to another, like sending an email or file over the internet.
  3. **[[Data at Rest]]**: Data that is not currently being accessed and is typically stored on physical devices, such as files stored on a laptop or server.
