### **[[Core]]**

The CSF core is a set of desired cybersecurity outcomes that help organizations customize their security plan. It consists of five functions, or parts: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. These functions are commonly used as an informative reference to help organizations _identify_ their most important assets and _protect_ those assets with appropriate safeguards. The CSF core is also used to understand ways to _detect_ attacks and develop _response_ and _recovery_ plans should an attack happen.
