### **Categories of threat**

**[[Threats]]** are circumstances or events that can negatively impact assets. There are many different types of threats. However, they are commonly categorized as two types: intentional and unintentional.

For example, an _intentional_ threat might be a malicious hacker who gains access to sensitive information by targeting a misconfigured application. An _unintentional_ threat might be an employee who holds the door open for an unknown person and grants them access to a restricted area. Either one can cause an event that must be responded to.
