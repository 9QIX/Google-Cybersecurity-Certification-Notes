# Assets in a digital world

**Data in the Digital Age**
- In today's connected world, valuable assets are often associated with information, which is primarily in digital form.
- **[[Data]]** refers to information that is processed, stored, or transmitted by computers and electronic devices.

**Challenges of Protecting Digital Assets**
- Protecting digital assets, particularly data, presents unique challenges compared to physical assets.
- Effective data protection depends on the state of the data and its location.

**States of Data and Information Security**
- [[Information security (InfoSec)]] is the practice of safeguarding data in all its states from unauthorized access.
- Security teams focus on protecting data in three primary states:
  1. **[[Data in Use]]**: Data actively being accessed by one or more users, such as reading an email or working on a document.
  2. **[[Data in Transit]]**: Data in the process of moving from one point to another, like sending an email or file over the internet.
  3. **[[Data at Rest]]**: Data that is not currently being accessed and is typically stored on physical devices, such as files stored on a laptop or server.

**Importance of Data Security**
- Weak information security can lead to serious consequences, including identity theft, financial losses, and damage to an organization's reputation.
- Security analysts play a critical role in protecting data and mitigating potential risks.

**Adapting to a Changing Digital Landscape**
- As our digital world evolves, our understanding of data at rest is changing. With the increasing use of cloud storage, data may not be at rest even when devices are not actively in use.
- Security professionals must remain vigilant and adaptable to emerging vulnerabilities in the connected world.

**Asset Management and Data Security**
- Data security is an integral part of asset management, and organizations need to consider the state of data when planning security measures.
- Understanding the three states of data (in use, in transit, at rest) enables security teams to assess risks and formulate asset management strategies for various scenarios.

By comprehending the significance of data as a valuable asset and the different states in which data exists, security analysts can contribute to effective information security practices, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical data.
