# Malicious software

Both humans and computers share a vulnerability to infection, though in different forms. Just as humans can get infected by viruses causing illnesses, computers can be infected by malware (malicious software) designed to harm devices or networks. Malware can spread through various means, including infected USB drives and online transmissions, and devices connected to the internet are especially susceptible.

### Five common types of malware and how they work:

1. **[[Virus]]:** Viruses are malicious code that interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. They hide within trusted applications and require user activation to start the infection.
2. **[[Worm]]:** Worms are self-replicating malware that can spread across systems independently. Unlike viruses, they don't require user actions to duplicate and infect other devices on a network.
3. **[[Trojan (Trojan Horse)]]:** Trojans are malware that appear as legitimate files or programs. They are often disguised as harmless applications to trick users into installing them. Trojans are commonly used to gain access to a system and install other malware, such as ransomware.
4. **[[Ransomware]]:** Ransomware is a type of malicious attack where attackers encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access. It's known to victims, and decryption is offered upon payment, although there's no guarantee of non-recurrence.
5. **[[Spyware]]:** Spyware is malware used to gather and sell information without consent. Unlike legitimate data collection by organizations, spyware is deployed to steal sensitive information such as login credentials and account PINs for personal gain.

The video highlights the constantly evolving nature of malware and the serious risks it poses to individuals and organizations. In the next part, the video is expected to explore how security teams detect and remove various forms of malware threats.
