### **[[Out-of-band SQL injection]]**

An out-of-band injection is one that uses a _different communication channel_ Â to launch the attack and gather the results.

For example, an attacker could use a malicious query to create a connection between a vulnerable website and a database they control. This separate channel would allow them to bypass any security controls that are in place on the website's server, allowing them to steal sensitive data

**Note:** Out-of-band injection attacks are very uncommon because they'll only work when certain features are enabled on the target server.
