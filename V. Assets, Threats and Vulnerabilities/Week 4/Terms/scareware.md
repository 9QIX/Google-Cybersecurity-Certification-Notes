## Scareware

Another type of PUA is **[[scareware]]**. This type of malware employs tactics to frighten users into infecting their own device. Scareware tricks users by displaying fake warnings that appear to come from legitimate companies. Email and pop-ups are just a couple of ways scareware is spread. Both can be used to deliver phony warnings with false claims about the user's files or data being at risk.
