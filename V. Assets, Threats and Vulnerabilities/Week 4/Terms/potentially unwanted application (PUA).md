Malicious adware falls into a sub-category of malware known as a **[[potentially unwanted application (PUA)]]**. A PUA is a type of unwanted software that is bundled in with legitimate programs which might display ads, cause device slowdown, or install other software. Attackers sometimes hide this type of malware in freeware with insecure design to monetize ads for themselves instead of the developer. This works even when the user has declined to receive ads.
