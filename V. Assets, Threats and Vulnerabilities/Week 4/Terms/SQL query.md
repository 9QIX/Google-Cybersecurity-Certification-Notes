A _[[SQL query]]_ is a request for data from a database. For example, a SQL query can request data from an organization's employee directory such as employee IDs, names, and job titles. A human resources application can accept an input that queries a SQL table to filter the data and locate a specific person. SQL injections can occur anywhere within a vulnerable application that can accept a SQL query.
