A type of targeted phishing that evolved in the 2010s is angler phishing. **[[Angler phishing]]** is a technique where attackers impersonate customer service representatives on social media. This tactic evolved from peopleâ€™s tendency to complain about businesses online. Threat actors intercept complaints from places like message boards or comment sections and contact the angry customer via social media. Like the AIM attacks of the 1990s, they use fraudulent accounts that appear similar to those of actual businesses. They then trick the angry customers into sharing sensitive information with the promise of fixing their problem.
