**[[Worm]]:** Worms are self-replicating malware that can spread across systems independently. Unlike viruses, they don't require user actions to duplicate and infect other devices on a network.

## Worm

A **[[worm]]** is malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own. Similar to a virus, a worm must be installed by the target user and can also be spread with tactics like malicious email. Given a worm's ability to spread on its own, attackers sometimes target devices, drives, or files that have shared access over a network.

A well known example is the Blaster worm, also known as Lovesan, Lovsan, or MSBlast. In the early 2000s, this worm spread itself on computers running Windows XP and Windows 2000 operating systems. It would force devices into a continuous loop of shutting down and restarting. Although it did not damage the infected devices, it was able to spread itself to hundreds of thousands of users around the world. Many variants of the Blaster worm have been deployed since the original and can infect modern computers.

**Note:** Worms were very popular attacks in the mid 2000s but are less frequently used in recent years.
