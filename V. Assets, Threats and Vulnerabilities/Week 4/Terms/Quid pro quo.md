**[[Quid pro quo]]** is a type of baiting used to trick someone into believing that theyâ€™ll be rewarded in return for sharing access, information, or money. For example, an attacker might impersonate a loan officer at a bank and call customers offering them a lower interest rate on their credit card. They'll tell the customers that they simply need to provide their account details to claim the deal.
