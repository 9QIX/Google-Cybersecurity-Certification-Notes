## Fileless malware

**[[Fileless malware]]** does not need to be installed by the user because it uses legitimate programs that are already installed to infect a computer. This type of infection resides in memory where the malware never touches the hard drive. This is unlike the other types of malware, which are stored within a file on disk. Instead, these stealthy infections get into the operating system or hide within trusted applications.

**Pro tip:** Fileless malware is detected by performing memory analysis, which requires experience with operating systems.Â
