# Cross-site scripting (XSS)

- **Malware Delivery:** Malicious software must be delivered to the target, whether on an individual computer or a network server. Common delivery methods include phishing and other social engineering techniques.
- **Web-Based Exploits:** Web-based exploits involve malicious code or behavior used to exploit coding vulnerabilities in web applications. Cybercriminals target these exploits to access sensitive information due to the high interaction level of web applications with multiple users across various networks.
- **Injection Attacks:** Injection attacks involve the insertion of malicious code into a vulnerable application, often running unnoticed in the background. Applications are vulnerable because they receive data inputs, such as user-entered information, which they should validate and handle correctly.
- **Challenges in Input Sanitization:** Web applications interact with multiple users and platforms, making it challenging for developers to anticipate and sanitize all possible input.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** XSS is a dangerous type of injection attack that inserts code into a vulnerable website or web application, often exploiting HTML and JavaScript. This provides cybercriminals with access to various data, including session cookies, geolocation, webcams, and microphones.
- **Types of XSS Attacks:** Three main types of XSS attacks are discussed:
	1. **Reflected XSS:** Malicious script is sent to the server and activated during the server's response, often delivered through deceptive web links.
	2. **Stored XSS:** Malicious script is directly injected on the server, targeting elements served to users, and can infect the site without user awareness.
	3. **DOM-Based XSS:** Malicious script exists within the web page's source code, requiring no interaction with the server to activate.
- **Purpose of XSS Attacks:** These attacks aim to steal sensitive information and can have severe consequences for web application users.

Security analysts are advised to familiarize themselves with injection attacks like XSS, as they pose a significant threat, though they are not the only form of cyberattacks, as explored in the next session.
