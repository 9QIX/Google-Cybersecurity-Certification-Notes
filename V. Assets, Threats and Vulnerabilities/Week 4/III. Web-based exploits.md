# Cross-site scripting (XSS)

- **Malware Delivery:** Malicious software must be delivered to the target, whether on an individual computer or a network server. Common delivery methods include phishing and other social engineering techniques.
- **[[Web-Based Exploits]]:** Web-based exploits involve malicious code or behavior used to exploit coding vulnerabilities in web applications. Cybercriminals target these exploits to access sensitive information due to the high interaction level of web applications with multiple users across various networks.
	- **[[Injection Attacks]]:** Injection attacks involve the insertion of malicious code into a vulnerable application, often running unnoticed in the background. Applications are vulnerable because they receive data inputs, such as user-entered information, which they should validate and handle correctly.
		- **Challenges in Input Sanitization:** Web applications interact with multiple users and platforms, making it challenging for developers to anticipate and sanitize all possible input.
- **[[Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)]]:** XSS is a dangerous type of injection attack that inserts code into a vulnerable website or web application, often exploiting HTML and JavaScript. This provides cybercriminals with access to various data, including session cookies, geolocation, webcams, and microphones.
	- **Types of XSS Attacks:** Three main types of XSS attacks are discussed:
		1. **[[Reflected XSS]]:** Malicious script is sent to the server and activated during the server's response, often delivered through deceptive web links.
		2. **[[Stored XSS]]:** Malicious script is directly injected on the server, targeting elements served to users, and can infect the site without user awareness.
		3. **[[DOM-Based XSS]]:** Malicious script exists within the web page's source code, requiring no interaction with the server to activate.
- **Purpose of XSS Attacks:** These attacks aim to steal sensitive information and can have severe consequences for web application users.

Security analysts are advised to familiarize themselves with injection attacks like XSS, as they pose a significant threat, though they are not the only form of cyberattacks, as explored in the next session.

# Exploitable gaps in databases

- **SQL in Web Applications:** SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used for creating, interacting with, and retrieving data from databases. Most web applications, including online shopping websites, employ SQL to manage their databases.
- **User-Friendly Web Interfaces:** Web applications provide user-friendly interfaces with menus, buttons, and other elements that allow users to interact with the application, often triggering SQL queries in the background.
- **SQL Injection Attacks:** SQL injection is a type of attack that exploits vulnerabilities in web applications, primarily in areas designed to accept user input. These vulnerabilities arise due to a lack of input sanitization.
- **Injection Points:** Common injection points include forms, such as login forms, where user input is directly incorporated into SQL statements.
- **Injection Mechanism:** Attackers insert additional SQL code into input fields, which can manipulate the server into executing unintended or malicious database queries.
- **Impact of SQL Injection:** Malicious hackers can exploit SQL injection to access sensitive information, modify database tables, and even gain administrative privileges.
- **Defense Against SQL Injection:** The best defense against SQL injection is proper input sanitization. Developers can write code that looks for specific SQL characters, ensuring that inputs are handled correctly. Prepared statements, a coding technique that executes SQL statements before database execution, are an effective way to guard against SQL injection, especially when user input is unknown.
- **Collaborative Efforts:** Preventing SQL injection requires well-written code and the collaborative effort of security teams and program developers to test applications for vulnerabilities.
- **Ongoing Security Preparedness:** Injection attacks are just one category of web-based exploits, and security teams continuously prepare for various threats.

The video emphasizes the significance of addressing SQL injection vulnerabilities through secure coding practices and collaboration between developers and security teams to enhance web application security. Injection attacks are among several threats that security teams need to be ready to confront.
