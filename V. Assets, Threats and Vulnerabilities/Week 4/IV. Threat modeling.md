# A proactive approach to security

- **Diverse Cyber Threats:** Different organizations and entities face varying types of threats based on their assets and defenses. Preparing for attacks involves understanding the specific risks associated with different targets.
- **Threat Modeling Definition:** **[[Threat modeling]]** is the process of identifying assets, their vulnerabilities, and the ways they are exposed to threats. It is a comprehensive security-related activity that can be applied to systems, applications, or business processes.
	- **Complex and Advanced Skill:** Creating threat models is a detailed and advanced security activity that usually involves a team of experienced professionals. It's considered an advanced skill in the field of cybersecurity.
	- **Threat Modeling Frameworks:** Several threat modeling frameworks are used in the industry, with each being more suitable for certain aspects of security, such as network security, information security, or application development.
- **Six Steps of Threat Modeling:**
	1. **[[Define Scope]]:** Determine the scope of the model by creating an inventory of assets and classifying them.
	2. **[[Identify Threats]]:** Define potential **threat actors**, characterizing them as internal or external.
		1. **[[threat actors]]** could be employees, hackers, or competing businesses. Internal or external.
		2. **[[Attack tree]]** - diagram that maps threats to assets. 
	3. **[[Characterize the Environment]]:** Adopt an attacker's perspective to understand how customers, employees, external partners, and vendors interact with the environment.
	4. **[[Analyze Threats]]:** Examine existing protections and identify gaps, ranking threats based on their risk scores.
	5. **[[Mitigate Risk]]:** Create a defense plan to mitigate threats, which may involve avoiding, transferring, reducing, or accepting risk.
	6. **[[Evaluate Findings]]:** Document all activities, implement necessary fixes, record successes, and note lessons learned for future threat modeling efforts.
- **Ongoing and Continuous Process:** Threat modeling is not a one-time task but a continuous and iterative process to ensure that an organization remains prepared and protected against evolving threats.

The video provides an overview of the threat modeling process and highlights that this is just one of many methods used in the field of cybersecurity to assess and mitigate threats.

# PASTA: The Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis

- **PASTA Framework:** PASTA stands for "Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis," and it is a widely used threat modeling framework in various industries.
- **Seven Stages of PASTA:**
	1. **Define Business and Security Objectives:** The first stage involves setting clear goals for the threat modeling exercise. In the example of the fitness company's mobile app, the main objective is protecting customer data.
	2. **Define Technical Scope:** In this stage, the focus is on identifying the components of the application that need evaluation, including the attack surface, such as network protocols and security controls.
	3. **Decompose the Application:** The team works on breaking down the application by identifying existing controls and producing a data flow diagram. This diagram helps visualize how data flows from users' devices to the company's database.
	4. **Threat Analysis:** The team collects up-to-date information on the types of attacks relevant to the application, considering various attack vectors used in mobile apps.
	5. **Vulnerability Analysis:** This stage involves a deeper investigation of potential vulnerabilities by addressing their root causes.
	6. **Attack Modeling:** The team simulates attacks based on the vulnerabilities analyzed in the previous stage. They create attack trees to map out attack vectors that need testing and validation.
	7. **Analyze Risk and Impact:** In the final stage, the team consolidates all the gathered information from the previous stages to make informed risk management recommendations to business stakeholders, aligning with the defined objectives.

The video successfully demonstrates how to apply the PASTA framework to assess and mitigate threats to a mobile app, ensuring the protection of customer data. This comprehensive threat modeling process aids organizations in enhancing their security measures effectively.
