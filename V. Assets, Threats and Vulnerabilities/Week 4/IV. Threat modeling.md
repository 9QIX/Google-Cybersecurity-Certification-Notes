# A proactive approach to security

- **Diverse Cyber Threats:** Different organizations and entities face varying types of threats based on their assets and defenses. Preparing for attacks involves understanding the specific risks associated with different targets.
- **Threat Modeling Definition:** **[[Threat modeling]]** is the process of identifying assets, their vulnerabilities, and the ways they are exposed to threats. It is a comprehensive security-related activity that can be applied to systems, applications, or business processes.
	- **Complex and Advanced Skill:** Creating threat models is a detailed and advanced security activity that usually involves a team of experienced professionals. It's considered an advanced skill in the field of cybersecurity.
	- **Threat Modeling Frameworks:** Several threat modeling frameworks are used in the industry, with each being more suitable for certain aspects of security, such as network security, information security, or application development.
- **Six Steps of Threat Modeling:**
	1. **[[Define Scope]]:** Determine the scope of the model by creating an inventory of assets and classifying them.
	2. **[[Identify Threats]]:** Define potential **threat actors**, characterizing them as internal or external.
		1. **[[Threat actors]]** could be employees, hackers, or competing businesses. Internal or external.
		2. **[[Attack tree]]** - diagram that maps threats to assets. 
	3. **[[Characterize the Environment]]:** Adopt an attacker's perspective to understand how customers, employees, external partners, and vendors interact with the environment.
	4. **[[Analyze Threats]]:** Examine existing protections and identify gaps, ranking threats based on their risk scores.
	5. **[[Mitigate Risk]]:** Create a defense plan to mitigate threats, which may involve avoiding, transferring, reducing, or accepting risk.
	6. **[[Evaluate Findings]]:** Document all activities, implement necessary fixes, record successes, and note lessons learned for future threat modeling efforts.
- **Ongoing and Continuous Process:** Threat modeling is not a one-time task but a continuous and iterative process to ensure that an organization remains prepared and protected against evolving threats.

The video provides an overview of the threat modeling process and highlights that this is just one of many methods used in the field of cybersecurity to assess and mitigate threats.
