# Reference guide: Linux

The Linux reference guide contains key Linux commands security professionals use to perform basic job duties. The reference guide is divided into six different categories of useful Linux commands for security-related tasks:Â 

- Navigate the file system
- Read files
- Manage the file system
- Filter content
- Manage users and their permissions
- Get help in Linux

# Reference guide: Linux
## Navigate the file system
The following Linux commands are helpful when navigating the file system.

- `cd`: Navigates between directories
    - `cd reports`: Navigates from the current working directory to its subdirectory reports
    - `cd /home/analyst/reports`: Navigates to the reports directory; the full path is required when reports is not a subdirectory of the current working directory
    - `cd ..`: Navigates to the directory that is one level above the current working directory

- `ls`: Displays the names of the files and directories
    - `ls`: Displays the names of the files and directories in the current working directory
    - `ls /home/analyst/reports`: Displays the names of the files and directories in the reports directory; providing an argument that specifies the path to a directory is necessary to display the contents of a directory other than the user's current working directory
    - `ls -a`: Displays hidden files when displaying the names of files and directories inside the current working directory
    - `ls -l`: Displays permissions to files and directories in the current working directory; also displays other additional information, including owner name, group, file size, and the time of the last modification
    - `ls -la`: Displays permissions to files and directories in the current working directory, including hidden files; also displays other additional information, including owner name, group, file size, and the time of last modification

- `pwd`: Prints the working directory to the screen
    - `pwd`: Prints the working directory to the screen, such as /home/analyst

- `whoami`: Returns the username of the current user
    - `whoami`: Returns the username of the current user, such as analyst or fgarcia

## Read files
The following Linux commands are helpful when reading files.

- `cat`: Displays the content of a file
    - `cat updates.txt`: Displays the content of the updates.txt file

- `head`: Displays just the beginning of a file, by default 10 lines
    - `head updates.txt`: Displays only the first 10 lines of the updates.txt file
    - `head -n 5 updates.txt`: Displays only the first five lines of the updates.txt file; the -n option allows users to specify the number of lines to return

- `less`: Returns the content of a file one page at a time
    - `less updates.txt`: Returns the content of updates.txt one page at a time; the less command changes the terminal window to a display that allows users to easily move forward and backward through content

- `tail`: Displays just the end of a file, by default 10 lines
    - `tail updates.txt`: Displays only the last 10 lines of the updates.txt file
    - `tail -n 5 updates.txt`: Returns only the last five lines of the updates.txt file; the -n option allows users to specify the number of lines to return

## Manage the file system
The following Linux commands are helpful when managing the file system.

- `cp`: Copies a file or directory into a new location; the file will not be removed from the previous location
    - `cp permissions.txt /home/analyst/logs`: Copies the permissions.txt file from the user's current working directory to the logs directory

- `mkdir`: Creates a new directory
    - `mkdir network`: Creates a new directory named network in the user's current working directory
    - `mkdir /home/analyst/logs network`: Creates a new directory named network in the logs directory; the full path is required when logs is not a subdirectory of the current directory

- `mv`: Moves a file or directory to a new location; the file is also removed from the previous location
    - `mv permissions.txt /home/analyst/logs`: Moves the permissions.txt file from the user's current working directory to the logs directory
    - `mv permissions.txt perm.txt`: Moves the permissions.txt file from the user's current working directory to the new file name perm.txt in the user's current working directory; this results in renaming the permissions.txt file as perm.txt

- `nano`: Opens or creates a file in the nano command-line file editor
    - `nano permissions.txt`: Opens an existing permissions.txt file in the nano file editor, or creates the permissions.txt file in the nano file editor if it doesn't already exist in the current working directory

- `rm`: Removes, or deletes, a file
    - `rm permissions.txt`: Removes the permissions.txt file from the user's current working directory
    - `rm home/analyst/reports/permissions.txt`: Removes the permissions.txt file from from the reports directory; the full path is required if the user's current working directory is not reports

- `rmdir`: Removes, or deletes, a directory; only removes directories if they are empty
    - `rmdir network`: Removes the empty network subdirectory of the user's current working directory from the file system
    - `rmdir /home/analyst/logs/network`: Removes the empty network directory from the file system; the full path is required when network is not a subdirectory of the current directory

- `touch`: Creates a new file
    - `touch permissions.txt`: Creates a new file named permissions.txt in the user's current working directory
    - `touch /home/analyst/reports/permissions.txt`: Creates a new file named permissions.txt in the reports directory; the full path is required if the user wants to create permissions.txt in any directory other than the current working directory

## Filter content
The following Linux commands are helpful when filtering content.

- `find`: Searches for directories and files that meet specified criteria
    - `find /home/analyst/projects`: Searches for all files starting at the projects directory
    - `find /home/analyst/projects -name "*log*"`: Searches for all files in the projects directory that contain the word log in the file name; the -name option searches for a specified string and is case-sensitive; the * wildcard represents zero or more unknown characters
    - `find /home/analyst/projects -iname "*log*"`: Searches for all files in the projects directory that contain the word log in the file name; the -iname option searches for a specified string and is not case-sensitive; the * wildcard represents zero or more unknown characters
    - `find /home/analyst/projects -mtime -3`: Searches for all files in the projects directory that have been modified within the past three days; the -mtime option bases its search for files or directories that were modified on days
    - `find /home/analyst/projects -mmin -15`: Searches for all files in the projects directory that have been modified within the past 15 minutes; the -mmin option bases its search for files or directories that were modified on minutes

- `grep`: Searches a specified file and returns all lines in the file containing a specified string
    - `grep OS updates.txt`: Searches the updates.txt file and returns all lines containing the string OS

- `|` (piping): Sends the standard output of one command as standard input to another command for further processing; accessed using the pipe character (|)
    - `ls /home/analyst/reports | grep users`: Redirects the standard output of ls /home/analyst/reports to be standard input for the grep users command, meaning that grep users identifies files and subdirectories in the /home/analyst/reports directory that contain the string users within their file name

## Manage users and their permissions
The following Linux commands are helpful when managing user permissions. (Also review the subentries for ls -l and ls -la in the ls entry of the Navigate the file system section.)
