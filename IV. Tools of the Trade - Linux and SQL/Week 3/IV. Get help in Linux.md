**Linux resources**

Previously, you were introduced to the Linux community and some resources that exist to help Linux users. Linux has many options available to give users the information they need. This reading will review these resources. When you’re aware of the resources available to you, you can continue to learn Linux independently. You can also discover even more ways that Linux can support your work as a security analyst.

**Linux community**

Linux has a large online community, and this is a huge resource for Linux users of all levels. You can likely find the answers to your questions with a simple online search. Troubleshooting issues by searching and reading online is an effective way to discover how others approached your issue. It’s also a great way for beginners to learn more about Linux.

The [Unix and Linux Stack Exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/) is a trusted resource for troubleshooting Linux issues. The Unix and Linux Stack Exchange is a question and answer website where community members can ask and answer questions about Linux. Community members vote on answers, so the higher quality answers are displayed at the top. Many of the questions are related to specific topics from advanced users, and the topics might help you troubleshoot issues as you continue using Linux.

**Integrated Linux support**

Linux also has several commands that you can use for support.

- `man`: The `man` command displays information on other commands and how they work. It’s short for “manual.” To search for information on a command, enter the command after `man`. For example, entering `man chown` returns detailed information about `chown`, including the various options you can use with it. The output of the `man` command is also called a “man page.”

- `apropos`: The `apropos` command searches the man page descriptions for a specified string. Man pages can be lengthy and difficult to search through if you’re looking for a specific keyword. To use `apropos`, enter the keyword after `apropos`. You can also include the `-a` option to search for multiple words. For example, entering `apropos -a graph editor` outputs man pages that contain both the words “graph" and "editor” in their descriptions.

- `whatis`: The `whatis` command displays a description of a command on a single line. For example, entering `whatis nano` outputs the description of `nano`. This command is useful when you don't need a detailed description, just a general idea of the command. This might be as a reminder. Or, it might be after you discover a new command through a colleague or online resource and want to know more.

**Key takeaways**

There are many resources available for troubleshooting issues or getting support for Linux. Linux has a large global community of users who ask and answer questions on online resources, such as the [Unix and Linux Stack Exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/). You can also use integrated support commands in Linux, such as `man`, `apropos`, and `whatis`.
