# **Basics of Linux Shell Commands**

In this section, we'll delve into the fundamental skills needed to communicate effectively with the Linux operating system through the shell. Proficiency in Linux commands is a core competency for security professionals, as it enables remote file navigation, management, and analysisâ€”especially in environments without a graphical user interface. You'll also need to configure user access, set file permissions, and authorize operations, making command-line proficiency a critical aspect of your role as a security analyst.

## **Understanding the [[Bash]] Shell**
- **[[Bash]]**: **Bash** (Bourne Again Shell) is the default shell in most Linux distributions. While there are different shells available, the key Linux commands you'll learn in this section are applicable across most shells.
- **[[Commands as Instructions]]**: In the shell, commands act as instructions that tell the computer what to do. These commands initiate various actions, from finding specific files to launching programs or outputting text.

## **Exploring Commands and Arguments**
- **[[Prompt and Dollar Sign]]**: When using the **[[Bash]]** shell, you'll notice a dollar sign ($) prompt before the cursor, indicating that you can input a new command.
- **[[Commands and Arguments]]**: A command is typically followed by arguments, which provide specific information required for the command's execution. Arguments help commands to perform their intended tasks.
- **[[Case Sensitivity]]**: It's important to remember that all commands, arguments, file names, and directory names in Linux are case-sensitive. Precision in command input is crucial as you progress in your Linux proficiency.

## **Practical Example: Echo Command**
- **[[Echo Command]]**: The **[[echo]]** command is used to display a specified string of text as output.
- **[[Providing Arguments]]**: To use the **[[echo]]** command effectively, you need to specify what text you want to display as output. This text is provided as an argument.
- **[[Case Sensitivity Reminder]]**: Linux commands and arguments, like the **[[echo]]** command and its arguments, must be entered with precise case sensitivity.

With a grasp of these fundamental concepts, you are well-prepared to dive into specific Linux commands in the following video, setting the stage for your journey to becoming a proficient security analyst.

# Core commands for navigation and reading files

In this section, we'll delve into the fundamental skills needed to navigate the Linux file system, which is a crucial skill for security professionals. Effective file system navigation allows you to locate and analyze logs, manage files and directories, and perform various tasks essential to security analysis.

## **Understanding the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
- **[[FHS]]**: The **[[Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)]]** is a vital component of the Linux OS that organizes data. Everything in Linux is considered a file somewhere within the directory structure.
- **[[Root Directory]]**: The root directory is the highest-level directory in Linux, denoted by a single slash (/). All other directories branch out from the root directory in a hierarchical structure.

## **Key Commands for File System Navigation**
- **[[pwd (Print Working Directory)]]**: This command prints the current working directory onto the screen, showing you where you are within the file system.
- **[[ls (List)]]**: The `ls` command displays the names of files and directories in the current working directory.
- **[[cd (Change Directory)]]**: The `cd` command is used to navigate between directories. It allows you to change your working directory.

## **Practical File System Navigation**
- **Executing Commands in Bash**: To execute commands in the Bash shell, you input the command followed by any necessary arguments and press Enter.
- **Examples**: In the video, practical examples demonstrate how to use the **[[pwd]]** command to display the current working directory, the **[[ls]]** command to list files and directories, and the **[[cd]]** command to change directories.

## **Reading File Content**
- **Reading Files**: Security analysts often need to read the content of files, such as configuration settings, user access reports, or logs.
- **Useful Commands**: The **[[cat]]** command displays the full content of a file, while the **[[head]]** command shows the beginning of a file (typically the first ten lines).

With these essential file system navigation and file reading commands in your toolkit, you're well-equipped to begin managing the Linux system, an integral aspect of your role as a security analyst. Stay tuned for the next video, where we'll explore system management in greater detail.
