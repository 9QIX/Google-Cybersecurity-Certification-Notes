**Introduction to [[sudo]]**
- **`sudo`**: `sudo` (super-user-do) is a command that temporarily grants elevated permissions to specific users.
- **Controlled Approach**: `sudo` offers controlled access to root privileges, unlike running every command as root.
- **Password Authentication**: When using `sudo`, users are prompted to enter their own password.
