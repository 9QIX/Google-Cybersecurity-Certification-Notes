**[[ls (List)]]**: The `ls` command displays the names of files and directories in the current working directory.

### **[[ls]]**

The `ls` command displays the names of the files and directories in the current working directory. For example, in the video, `ls` returned directories such as `logs`, and a file called `updates.txt`. 

**Note**: If you want to return the contents of a directory that’s not your current working directory, you can add an argument after ls with the absolute or relative file path to the desired directory. For example, if you’re in the /home/analyst directory but want to list the contents of its `projects` subdirectory, you can enter `ls /home/analyst/projects` or just `ls projects`.
