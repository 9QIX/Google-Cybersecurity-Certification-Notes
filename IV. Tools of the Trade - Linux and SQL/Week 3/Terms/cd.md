**[[cd (Change Directory)]]**: The `cd` command is used to navigate between directories. It allows you to change your working directory.

### **[[cd]]**

The `cd` command navigates between directories. When you need to change directories, you should use this command.

To navigate to a subdirectory of the current directory, you can add an argument after `cd` with the subdirectory name. For example, if you’re in the `/home/analyst` directory and want to navigate to its projects subdirectory, you can enter `cd projects`.

You can also navigate to any specific directory by entering the absolute file path. For example, if you’re in `/home/analyst/projects`, entering `cd /home/analyst/logs` changes your current directory to /home/analyst/logs.

**Pro Tip**: You can use the relative file path and enter `cd ..` to go up one level in the file structure. For example, if the current directory is `/home/analyst/projects`, entering `cd ..` would change your working directory to `/home/analyst`.
