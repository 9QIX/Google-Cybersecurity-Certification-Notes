### **[[mkdir]]**

The `mkdir` command creates a new directory. Like all of the commands presented in this reading, you can either provide the new directory as the absolute file path, which starts from the root, or as a relative file path, which starts from your current directory.

For example, if you want to create a new directory called `network` in your `/home/analyst/logs` directory, you can enter `mkdir /home/analyst/logs/network` to create this new directory. If you're already in the `/home/analyst/logs` directory, you can also create this new directory by entering `mkdir network`.

*Pro Tip*: You can use the `ls` command to confirm the new directory was added.
