### **[[less]]**

The `less` command returns the content of a file one page at a time. For example, entering `less updates.txt` changes the terminal window to display the contents of `updates.txt` one page at a time. This allows you to easily move forward and backward through the content. 

Once you’ve accessed your content with the `less` command, you can use several keyboard controls to move through the file:

- `Space bar`: Move forward one page
- `b`: Move back one page
- `Down arrow`: Move forward one line
- `Up arrow`: Move back one line
- `q`: Quit and return to the previous terminal window
