### **[[tail]]**

The `tail` command does the opposite of `head`. This command can be used to display just the end of a file, by default 10 lines. Entering `tail updates.txt` returns only the last 10 lines of the `updates.txt` file.

**Pro Tip**: You can use `tail` to read the most recent information in a log file.
