**Introduction to `chmod`**
- **Definition**: `chmod` is a Linux command used to change permissions on files and directories. It stands for "change mode."
- **Modes**: There are two modes for changing permissions, but this video focuses on symbolic mode.

**Components of `chmod` Syntax**
- **Target**: The target specifies the file or directory for which permissions will be adjusted. It's the final argument after the `chmod` command.
- **Owner Types**: To identify owners, use "u" for user, "g" for group, and "o" for other. These are separated by commas in the argument.
- **Operators**: Operators determine whether permissions should be added or removed. Use "+" to add permissions and "-" to remove them.
- **Permissions**: Permissions are represented by symbols. For example, "r" represents read, "w" represents write, and "x" represents execute.

**Working Example**
- **Scenario**: Suppose you want to give write permissions to the group and remove read permissions from others.
- **Command**: To achieve this, you would use the following `chmod` command:

```bash
chmod g+w,o-r filename
```
