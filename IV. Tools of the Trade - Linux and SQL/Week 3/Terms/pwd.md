**[[pwd (Print Working Directory)]]**: This command prints the current working directory onto the screen, showing you where you are within the file system.
### **[[pwd]]**

The `pwd` command prints the working directory to the screen. Or in other words, it returns the directory that you’re currently in. 

The output gives you the absolute path to this directory. For example, if you’re in your `home` directory and your username is `analyst`, entering `pwd` returns `/home/analyst`. 

**Pro Tip**: To learn what your username is, use the `whoami` command. The `whoami` command returns the username of the current user. For example, if your username is `analyst`, entering `whoami` returns `analyst`.
