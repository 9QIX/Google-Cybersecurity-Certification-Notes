You can also use `mv` and `cp` when working with files. The `mv` command moves a file or directory to a new location, and the `cp` command copies a file or directory into a new location. The first argument after `mv` or `cp` is the file or directory you want to move or copy, and the second argument is the location you want to move or copy it to.
