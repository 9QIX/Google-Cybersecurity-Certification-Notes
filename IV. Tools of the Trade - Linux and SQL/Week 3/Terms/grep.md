### [[grep]]

The `grep` command searches a specified file and returns all lines in the file containing a specified string. The `grep` command commonly takes two arguments: a specific string to search for and a specific file to search through.

For example, entering `grep OS updates.txt` returns all lines containing `OS` in the `updates.txt` file. In this example, `OS` is the specific string to search for, and `updates.txt` is the specific file to search through.
