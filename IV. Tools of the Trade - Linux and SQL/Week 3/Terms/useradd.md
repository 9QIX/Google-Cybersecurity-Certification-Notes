**Adding Users with [[useradd]]**
- **`useradd`**: `useradd` is a command that adds a user to the system.
- **Prerequisites**: Only the root user or users with sudo privileges can use `useradd`.
- **Example**: To add a user named "salesrep7," use the command `sudo useradd salesrep7`.

### **[[useradd]]**

The `useradd` command adds a user to the system. To add a user with the username of `fgarcia` with `sudo`, enter `sudo useradd fgarcia`. There are additional options you can use with `useradd`:

- `-g`: Sets the userâ€™s default group, also called their primary group
- `-G`: Adds the user to additional groups, also called supplemental or secondary groups

To use the `-g` option, the primary group must be specified after `-g`. For example, entering `sudo useradd -g security fgarcia` adds `fgarcia` as a new user and assigns their primary group to be `security`.

To use the `-G` option, the supplemental group must be passed into the command after `-G`. You can add more than one supplemental group at a time with the `-G` option. Entering `sudo useradd -G finance,admin fgarcia` adds `fgarcia` as a new user and adds them to the existing `finance` and `admin` groups.
