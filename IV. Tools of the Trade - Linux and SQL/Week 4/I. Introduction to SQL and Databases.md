# Introduction to databases

**Definition of a Database**
- A database is defined as an organized collection of information or data.
- Databases are more powerful than spreadsheets and can handle massive amounts of data.
- They allow for simultaneous access by multiple users and can perform complex tasks.

**Database Organization**
- Databases are organized and structured to store data efficiently.
- Relational databases, which we'll focus on, consist of related tables.
- These tables have fields (columns) and records (rows) containing specific data.

**Components of a Relational Database**
- Tables contain fields (columns) that represent specific attributes of the data.
- Rows (records) contain data related to the columns.
- Multiple tables can be connected if they share a common column, known as a key.

**Types of Keys in Relational Databases**
- **Primary Key**: A primary key is a column with unique values for each row, ensuring that no duplicates or empty values exist. It uniquely identifies each row in the table.
- **Foreign Key**: A foreign key is a column in one table that serves as a primary key in another table. It connects two tables and can have empty values or duplicates.

**Primary vs. Foreign Keys**
- A table can have only one primary key, but it can have multiple foreign keys.
- Primary keys ensure data uniqueness and integrity, while foreign keys establish relationships between tables.

**Introduction to SQL**
- SQL (Structured Query Language) is the language used to interact with relational databases.
- SQL allows users to perform various operations on databases, such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.

This video provides a foundation for understanding the role of databases in data storage and retrieval for security analysts and introduces the concepts of tables, keys, and SQL.
