In this video, we performed our first SQL query to retrieve specific data from a table. Here's a summary of the key points covered:

### **Running Your First SQL Query**

**Query Objective**
- The goal of the SQL query was to determine which computer is assigned to a specific employee using the "employees" table.

**SQL Keywords: SELECT and FROM**
- SQL queries involve two essential keywords: SELECT and FROM.
- **[[SELECT]]** is used to specify which columns to return in the query result.
- **[[FROM]]** indicates the table from which the data should be retrieved.

**SQL Syntax and Case Sensitivity**
- SQL keywords are not case-sensitive, but they are commonly written in uppercase for clarity.
- Semicolons are placed at the end of SQL statements to mark the statement's termination.

**Writing the SQL Query**
- We crafted the SQL statement to select the "employee_id" and "device_id" columns from the "employees" table.
- The query syntax is straightforward and resembles everyday language.

**Running the Query**
- After entering the SQL query, we executed it, and the output displayed the relevant information, matching employees with their assigned computers.

**Selecting All Columns**
- To retrieve all columns from the table, we used an asterisk (*) after SELECT, indicating "select all."
- This allowed us to view the entire "employees" table.

**Conclusion**
- We successfully executed a basic SQL query, which is a fundamental skill for retrieving specific data from a database table.
- In the next video, we will explore adding filters to our SQL queries for more precise data retrieval.

Executing SQL queries is a foundational skill for security analysts, enabling them to extract valuable information from databases for analysis and decision-making.
