**Using the AND Operator**
- The **[[AND operator]]** in SQL specifies that both conditions must be met simultaneously.
- It is used when you want to select data that satisfies multiple conditions at the same time.
- For example, to find machines with both Operating System 1 and Email Client 1, you would use the AND operator: `SELECT * FROM machines WHERE operating_system = 'OS 1' AND email_client = 'Email Client 1';`
