### **[[Structure]]**

SQL offers a lot more structure than Linux, which is more free-form and not as tidy.

For example, if you wanted to access a log of employee log-in attempts, SQL would have each record separated into columns. Linux would print the data as a line of text without this organization. As a result, selecting a specific column to analyze would be easier and more efficient in SQL.

In terms of structure, SQL provides results that are more easily readable and that can be adjusted more quickly than when using Linux.
