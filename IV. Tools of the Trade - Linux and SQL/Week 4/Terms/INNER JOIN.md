**INNER JOIN**
- An **[[INNER JOIN]]** in SQL returns rows that have matching values in a specified column in both tables.
- It combines rows from two tables based on a common column.
- In the example, an INNER JOIN between the `employees` and `machines` tables used the `employee_id` column as the common column to retrieve data from both tables.
