### [[AND]]

First, `AND` is used to filter on two conditions. `AND` specifies that both conditions must be met simultaneously. 

As an example, a cybersecurity concern might affect only those customer accounts that meet both the condition of being handled by a support representative with an ID of 5 and the condition of being located in the USA. To find the names and emails of those specific customers, you should place the two conditions on either side of the `AND` operator in the `WHERE` clause:

```sql
SELECT firstname, lastname, email, country, supportrepid
FROM customers
WHERE supportrepid = 5 AND country = 'USA';
```
Output:
```sql
|-----------|----------|-------------------------|---------|--------------
| FirstName | LastName | Email                   | Country | SupportRepId 
|-----------|----------|-------------------------|---------|--------------
| Jack      | Smith    | jacksmith@microsoft.com | USA     |            5 
| Kathy     | Chase    | kachase@hotmail.com     | USA     |            5 
| Victor    | Stevens  | vstevens@yahoo.com      | USA     |            5 
| Julia     | Barnett  | jubarnett@gmail.com     | USA     |            5 |-----------|----------|-------------------------|---------|--------------
```

Running this query returns four rows of information about the customers. You can use this information to contact them about the security concern.
