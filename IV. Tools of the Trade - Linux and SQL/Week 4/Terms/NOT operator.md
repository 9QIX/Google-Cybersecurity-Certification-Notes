**Using the NOT Operator**
- The **[[NOT operator]]** in SQL negates a condition, selecting data that does not match the specified condition.
- It is used when you want to exclude certain data from the results.
- For example, to update all devices in your company except those running Operating System 3, you would use the NOT operator: `SELECT * FROM machines WHERE NOT operating_system = 'OS 3';`
