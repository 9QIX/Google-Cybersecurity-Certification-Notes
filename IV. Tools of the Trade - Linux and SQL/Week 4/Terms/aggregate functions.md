## Aggregate functions

In SQL, **[[aggregate functions]]** are functions that perform a calculation over multiple data points and return the result of the calculation. The actual data is not returned.

There are various aggregate functions that perform different calculations:
- `COUNT` returns a single number that represents the number of rows returned from your query.
- `AVG` returns a single number that represents the average of the numerical data in a column.
- `SUM` returns a single number that represents the sum of the numerical data in a column.
