# GUI versus CLI

- **[[User Interface (UI)]]:** A program that allows users to interact with the operating system and control its functions. Two common types of UI are the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the Command-Line Interface (CLI).
- **[[Graphical User Interface (GUI)]]:** A user interface that utilizes icons, graphics, and menus on the screen to manage tasks on a computer. GUIs are commonly used in personal computers and smartphones. They include components like a start menu, taskbar, desktop icons, and shortcuts, making it user-friendly for executing tasks.
- **[[Command-Line Interface (CLI)]]:** A text-based user interface that relies on commands typed in by the user to interact with the operating system. CLI is more flexible and powerful than GUI, allowing for customization and multitasking. It resembles coding in a text-based language and is commonly used by security analysts for tasks like log analysis and user authentication.
- **[[Security Analyst]]:** A professional responsible for identifying, mitigating, and responding to security threats and incidents within a computer system.
- **[[Log Analysis]]:** The process of reviewing and interpreting log files generated by computer systems to identify security events, anomalies, or potential threats.
- **[[Authentication]]:** The process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system to ensure authorized access.
- **[[Authorization]]:** Granting or denying permissions and access rights to authenticated users or systems based on predefined rules and policies.
- **[[Linux]]:** An open-source operating system commonly used in the security industry and by security analysts for its command-line capabilities and flexibility.
- **[[Customization]]:** The ability to tailor commands and processes to specific needs, allowing users to perform multiple tasks simultaneously and efficiently.
- **[[Multitasking]]:** The capability to execute multiple tasks concurrently, improving efficiency and productivity in computer operations.
