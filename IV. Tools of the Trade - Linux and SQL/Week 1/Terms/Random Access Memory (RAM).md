**[[Random Access Memory (RAM)]]** is a hardware component used for short-term memory. If a computer has 16GB of RAM, it can host three virtual machines so that the physical computer and virtual machines each have 4GB of RAM. Also, each of these virtual machines would have their own operating system and function similarly to a typical computer.


**[[Random Access Memory (RAM)]]** is a hardware component used for short-term memory. It’s where data is stored temporarily as you perform tasks on your computer. For example, if you’re writing a report on your computer, the data needed for this is stored in RAM. After you’ve finished writing the report and closed down that program, this data is deleted from RAM. Information in RAM cannot be accessed once the computer has been turned off. The CPU takes the data from RAM to run programs.
