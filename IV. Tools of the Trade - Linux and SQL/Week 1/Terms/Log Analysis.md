**[[Log Analysis]]:** The process of reviewing and interpreting log files generated by computer systems to identify security events, anomalies, or potential threats.

**Log Analysis:** **[[Log analysis]]** is the process of examining logs to identify events of interest. Given the vast amount of log data generated from different sources, it's important to be selective about what to log. This selective logging approach helps reduce the time spent sifting through log data.

Security teams access logs from logging receivers like SIEM tools which consolidate logs to provide a central repository for log data. Security professionals use logs to perform **[[log analysis]]**, which is the process of examining logs to identify events of interest. Logs help uncover the details surrounding the 5 W's of incident investigation: _who_ triggered the incident, _what_ happened, _when_ the incident took place, _where_ the incident took place, and _why_ the incident occurred.Â
