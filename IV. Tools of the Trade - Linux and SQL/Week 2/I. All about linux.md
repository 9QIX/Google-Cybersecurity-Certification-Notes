- **[[Applications]]:** Applications, also known as programs, are software designed to perform specific tasks. For instance, a word processor or a calculator is considered an application. **[[Linux applications]]** are often distributed through package managers, simplifying the installation process.

**Communication Interface**:
- **[[Shell]]:** The shell is a vital element in the **[[Linux architecture]]**, serving as the command line interpreter. It processes user commands and provides the results. It corresponds to the Command-Line Interface (CLI) used to communicate with the system.

**Data Organization**:
- **[[Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)]]:** FHS is responsible for organizing and structuring data within the **[[Linux operating system]]**. Think of it as a filing cabinet for data, ensuring data is stored in an organized manner, making it easily accessible when needed.

**System Management**:
- **[[Kernel]]:** The kernel is the core component of the **[[Linux OS]]**. It manages processes and memory and communicates with hardware to execute commands initiated by the user through the shell. **[[Drivers]]** are employed by the kernel to enable applications to interact with hardware efficiently.

**Hardware**:
- **[[Hardware]]:** Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer, such as the Central Processing Unit (CPU), mouse, keyboard, and more. These components interact with the software applications and the kernel to execute tasks.

Understanding the architecture of **[[Linux]]** is pivotal for security professionals as it forms the foundation for effectively analyzing and securing a **[[Linux-based system]]**. This knowledge equips security analysts with the insights needed to navigate and safeguard **[[Linux systems]]** effectively.

You've provided an excellent explanation of the Linux architecture. Here's your text with key terms emphasized using double square brackets:

# **Linux Architecture Explained**

Understanding the **[[Linux architecture]]** is important for a security analyst. When you understand how a system is organized, it makes it easier to understand how it functions. In this reading, you’ll learn more about the individual components in the **[[Linux architecture]]**. A request to complete a task starts with the **[[user]]** and then flows through **[[applications]]**, the **[[shell]]**, the **[[Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)]]**, the **[[kernel]]**, and the **[[hardware]]**.

### 1. **User**
The **[[user]]** is the person interacting with a computer. They initiate and manage computer tasks. Linux is a multi-user system, which means that multiple users can use the same resources at the same time.

### 2. **Applications**
An **[[application]]** is a program that performs a specific task. There are many different applications on your computer. Some applications typically come pre-installed on your computer, such as calculators or calendars. Other applications might have to be installed, such as some web browsers or email clients. In Linux, you'll often use a **[[package manager]]** to install applications. A **[[package manager]]** is a tool that helps users install, manage, and remove packages or applications. A **[[package]]** is a piece of software that can be combined with other packages to form an application.

### 3. **Shell**
The **[[shell]]** is the command-line interpreter. Everything entered into the shell is text-based. The shell allows users to give commands to the **[[kernel]]** and receive responses from it. You can think of the shell as a translator between you and your computer. The shell translates the commands you enter so that the computer can perform the tasks you want.

### 4. **Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)**
The **[[Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)]]** is the component of the **[[Linux OS]]** that organizes data. It specifies the location where data is stored in the operating system. 

A **[[directory]]** is a file that organizes where other files are stored. Directories are sometimes called “folders,” and they can contain files or other directories. The **[[FHS]]** defines how directories, directory contents, and other storage are organized so the operating system knows where to find specific data. 

### 5. **Kernel**
The **[[kernel]]** is the component of the **[[Linux OS]]** that manages processes and memory. It communicates with the applications to route commands. The Linux kernel is unique to the Linux OS and is critical for allocating resources in the system. The kernel controls all major functions of the **[[hardware]]**, which can help get tasks expedited more efficiently.

### 6. **Hardware**
The **[[hardware]]** is the physical components of a computer. You might be familiar with some hardware components, such as hard drives or CPUs. Hardware is categorized as either peripheral or internal.

**Peripheral devices**
**[[Peripheral devices]]** are hardware components that are attached and controlled by the computer system. They are not core components needed to run the computer system. Peripheral devices can be added or removed freely. Examples of peripheral devices include monitors, printers, the keyboard, and the mouse.

**Internal hardware**
**[[Internal hardware]]** are the components required to run the computer. Internal hardware includes a main circuit board and all components attached to it. This main circuit board is also called the motherboard. Internal hardware includes the following: 

- The **[[Central Processing Unit (CPU)]]** is a computer’s main processor, which is used to perform general computing tasks on a computer. The CPU executes the instructions provided by programs, which enables these programs to run. 
- **[[Random Access Memory (RAM)]]** is a hardware component used for short-term memory. It’s where data is stored temporarily as you perform tasks on your computer. For example, if you’re writing a report on your computer, the data needed for this is stored in RAM. After you’ve finished writing the report and closed down that program, this data is deleted from RAM. Information in RAM cannot be accessed once the computer has been turned off. The CPU takes the data from RAM to run programs. 
- The **[[hard drive]]** is a hardware component used for long-term memory. It’s where programs and files are stored for the computer to access later. Information on the hard drive can be accessed even after a computer has been turned off and on again. A computer can have multiple hard drives.

**Key Takeaways**
It’s important for **[[security analysts]]** to understand the **[[Linux architecture]]** and how these components are organized. The components of the **[[Linux architecture]]** are the **[[user]]**, **[[applications]]**, **[[shell]]**, **[[Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)]]**, **[[kernel]]**, and **[[hardware]]**. Each of these components is important in how **[[Linux]]** functions.
