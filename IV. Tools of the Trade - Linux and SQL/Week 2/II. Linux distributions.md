# **Linux Distributions**

To effectively navigate the Linux landscape as a security analyst, it's crucial to grasp the concept of **[[Linux distributions]]**, often referred to as distros. These distributions offer a high level of customization and cater to various needs and preferences of users. Let's explore the significance of **[[Linux distributions]]** in the context of security analysis:

**Linux Distributions Overview**:
- **Definition:** **[[Linux distributions]]**, also known as distros or flavors of Linux, are customized versions of the Linux operating system. Each distribution is built around the Linux kernel and offers a unique combination of preinstalled programs, user interfaces, and system configurations.

**Analogical Understanding**:
- **Vehicle Analogy:** Think of **[[Linux distributions]]** like vehicles. The **[[Linux kernel]]**, akin to an engine in a vehicle, is the heart of the operating system. Just as manufacturers use the same engine to create different types of vehicles (trucks, cars, buses, etc.), Linux enthusiasts can take the open-source **[[Linux kernel]]** and customize it to create various distributions.
- **Diverse Purposes:** Different vehicles serve distinct purposes, just as **[[Linux distributions]]** are tailored for various needs. For instance, some distributions are designed for general-purpose computing, while others target specific tasks, such as penetration testing or server management.
- **Customization:** Like vehicles with varying components (e.g., control panels in aircraft or the number of tires on trucks), **[[Linux distributions]]** include diverse preinstalled programs, utilities, and user interfaces. Users select a distribution based on their specific requirements or preferences.

**Advantages of Linux Customization**:
- **Customizability:** **[[Linux distributions]]** include essential components like the **[[Linux kernel]]**, utilities, a package management system, and an installer. Being open source, Linux allows users and developers to contribute to the source code and create new distributions tailored to specific needs.

**Hierarchy of Distributions**:
- **Derived from Parent Distributions:** Most **[[Linux distributions]]** are derived from existing distributions. Some distributions, known as parent distributions, serve as the basis for others. For instance, Red Hat is the parent of CentOS, and Slackware is the parent of SUSE. Ubuntu and KALI LINUX™ are derived from Debian.

**Relevance to Security Analysts**:
- **Critical Knowledge:** As a security analyst, understanding different **[[Linux distributions]]** is essential. Familiarity with these distributions facilitates your work, as specific tools and applications may be available on one distribution but not on another. Knowing which distribution suits your security needs can streamline your tasks and enhance your effectiveness.

In the following sections, we will explore some of the **[[Linux distributions]]** commonly used by security analysts, providing insights into their features and functionalities, further enhancing your proficiency in the field of security analysis.

These tools empower security analysts to efficiently carry out their responsibilities in securing systems, networks, and data.

As we progress, we will explore additional Linux distributions that hold relevance in the realm of security analysis, providing insights into their distinctive features and applications for security professionals.

# More Linux Distributions

Previously, you were introduced to different distributions of Linux. This included **[[KALI LINUX™]]**. (**[[KALI LINUX™]]** is a trademark of OffSec.) In addition to **[[KALI LINUX™]]**, there are multiple other Linux distributions that security analysts should be familiar with. In this reading, you’ll learn about additional Linux distributions.

**[[KALI LINUX™]]**
**[[KALI LINUX™]]** is an open-source distribution of Linux that is widely used in the security industry. This is because **[[KALI LINUX™]]**, which is Debian-based, is pre-installed with many useful tools for penetration testing and digital forensics. A penetration test is a simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes. Digital forensics is the practice of collecting and analyzing data to determine what has happened after an attack. These are key activities in the security industry.

However, **[[KALI LINUX™]]** is not the only Linux distribution that is used in cybersecurity.

**Ubuntu**
**[[Ubuntu]]** is an open-source, user-friendly distribution that is widely used in security and other industries. It has both a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI). **[[Ubuntu]]** is also Debian-derived and includes common applications by default. Users can also download many more applications from a package manager, including security-focused tools. Because of its wide use, **[[Ubuntu]]** has an especially large number of community resources to support users.

**[[Ubuntu]]** is also widely used for cloud computing. As organizations migrate to cloud servers, cybersecurity work may more regularly involve **[[Ubuntu]]** derivatives.

**Parrot**
**[[Parrot]]** is an open-source distribution that is commonly used for security. Similar to **[[KALI LINUX™]]**, **[[Parrot]]** comes with pre-installed tools related to penetration testing and digital forensics. Like both **[[KALI LINUX™]]** and **[[Ubuntu]]**, it is based on Debian.

**[[Parrot]]** is also considered to be a user-friendly Linux distribution. This is because it has a GUI that many find easy to navigate. This is in addition to **[[Parrot]]**’s CLI.

**Red Hat® Enterprise Linux®**
**[[Red Hat® Enterprise Linux®]]** is a subscription-based distribution of Linux built for enterprise use. **[[Red Hat]]** is not free, which is a major difference from the previously mentioned distributions. Because it’s built and supported for enterprise use, **[[Red Hat]]** also offers a dedicated support team for customers to call about issues.

**CentOS**
**[[CentOS]]** is an open-source distribution that is closely related to **[[Red Hat]]**. It uses source code published by **[[Red Hat]]** to provide a similar platform. However, **[[CentOS]]** does not offer the same enterprise support that **[[Red Hat]]** provides and is supported through the community.

**Key takeaways**
**[[KALI LINUX™]], [[Ubuntu]], [[Parrot]], [[Red Hat® Enterprise Linux®]],** and **[[CentOS]]** are all widely used Linux distributions. It’s important for security analysts to be aware of these distributions that they might encounter in their career.
