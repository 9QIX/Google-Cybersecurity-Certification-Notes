## Penetration testing

A **[[penetration test]]**, or pen test, is a simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes. The simulated attack in a pen test involves using the same tools and techniques as malicious actors in order to mimic a real life attack. Since a pen test is an authorized attack, it is considered to be a form of ethical hacking. Unlike a vulnerability assessment that finds weaknesses in a system's security, a pen test exploits those weaknesses to determine the potential consequences if the system breaks or gets broken into by a threat actor.

For example, the cybersecurity team at a financial company might simulate an attack on their banking app to determine if there are weaknesses that would allow an attacker to steal customer information or illegally transfer funds. If the pen test uncovers misconfigurations, the team can address them and improve the overall security of the app.  

**Note:** Organizations that are regulated by PCI DSS, HIPAA, or GDPR must routinely perform penetration testing to maintain compliance standards.
