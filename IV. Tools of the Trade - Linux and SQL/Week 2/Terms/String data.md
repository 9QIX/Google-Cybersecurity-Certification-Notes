**[[String data]]** - is data consisting of an ordered sequence of characters. In our example, we'll just have it output the string of: hello. So, as input, we'll type: echo hello into the shell. Later, when we press enter, we'll get the output.

**[[String Data]]**: Consists of an ordered sequence of characters, including numbers, letters, or symbols (e.g., user names like "analyst10").

## String

In Python, **[[string data]]** is data consisting of an ordered sequence of characters. Characters in a string may include letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces. These characters must be placed within quotation marks. These are all valid strings:

- `"updates needed"`
- `"20%"`
- `"5.0"`
- `"35"`
- `"**/**/**"`  
- `""`

**Note:** The last item (`""`), which doesn't contain anything within the quotation marks, is called an empty string.

You can use the `print()` function to display a string. You can explore this by running this code:

```python
print("updates needed")
```
Output
```python
updates needed
```

The code prints "updates needed".

You can place strings in either double quotation marks (`""`) or single quotation marks (`''`). The following code demonstrates that the same message prints when the string is in single quotation marks:

```python
print('updates needed')
```
Output
```python
updates needed
```

**Note:** Choosing one type of quotation marks and using it consistently makes it easier to read your code. This course uses double quotation marks.
