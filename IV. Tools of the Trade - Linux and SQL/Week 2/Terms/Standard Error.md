**Errors: [[Standard Error]] (stderr)**:
- **Handling Mistakes and Exceptions**: Standard error comprises error messages delivered by the operating system via the shell. Just as your friend might admit they can't answer a question, the system issues an error message when it encounters difficulties understanding or executing your command. This can occur due to misspelled commands, unknown command responses, or insufficient permissions.
