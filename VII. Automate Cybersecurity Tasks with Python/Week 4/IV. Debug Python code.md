# Debugging strategies

- **Objective:** The passage aims to address the challenges associated with debugging code, emphasizing its significance for ensuring code functionality. It introduces three types of errors—syntax errors, logic errors, and exceptions—and explores techniques for identifying and fixing them.
- **[[Debugging]]**: is the practice of identifying and fixing errors in code. 
- **[[Types of Errors]]:**
	1. **[[Syntax Errors]]:**
		- Definition: Invalid usage of the Python language.
		- Example: Forgetting to add a colon after a function header.
		- Resolution: Locate and correct the error indicated by error messages.
	2. **[[Logic Errors]]:**
		- Definition: Errors that may not cause error messages but produce unintended results.
		- Example: Writing incorrect text within a print statement or using the wrong comparison operator.
		- Debugging Strategies:
			- Use print statements to identify functioning sections.
			- Employ a debugger to insert breakpoints and run code sections independently.
	3. **[[Exceptions]]:**
		- Definition: Occur when the program encounters difficulties in executing code, despite correct syntax.
		- Examples: Division by 0, accessing nonexistent index values, unrecognized variable or function names, or incorrect data types.
		- Debugging Tools:
		- Use debuggers to identify potential sources of error.
		- Employ print statements to analyze code execution.
- **Diagnosing Logic Errors:**
	- Suggested Strategies:
		- Insert print statements throughout the code, describing their location.
		- Utilize a debugger to set breakpoints, allowing the isolation of code sections for independent execution.
- **Handling Exceptions:**
	- Understanding common scenarios leading to exceptions (e.g., mathematical impossibility or incorrect data types).
	- Utilizing debuggers and print statements to identify and resolve exception errors.
- **Conclusion:** The passage concludes by emphasizing the inevitability of errors and exceptions in Python programming and highlights the importance of acquiring debugging skills. The information provided is intended to equip the learner with insights into effective code debugging, ensuring the functionality of written code.

# Apply debugging strategies

- **Objective:** The passage aims to guide the reader through the process of debugging Python code by using a specific example. The purpose of the code is to parse a single line from a log file, and the debugging process involves identifying and fixing syntax errors, name errors (a type of exception), and logic errors.
- **Debugging Process:**
	1. **Identifying Syntax Errors:**
		- Error: A syntax error is detected in the line defining a function.
		- Resolution: Add a missing colon at the end of the function header.
	2. **Addressing Name Error (Exception):**
		- Error: A "name error" occurs related to the variable `application_name`.
		- Resolution: Identify and correct the misspelling of the variable (`application_name`).
	3. **Checking Logic Errors:**
		- Error: The logic of the program doesn't work as intended. If the status code is 200, the code should print a message instead of parsing the line.
		- Debugging Strategies:
			- Insert print statements to identify the issue.
			- Identify that the program does not enter the if statement related to the 200 status code.
	4. **Fixing Logic Error:**
		- Issue: The program doesn't enter the if statement checking for the 200 status code because the return statement precedes it.
		- Resolution: Move the if statement to check the status code before the return statement to ensure proper execution.
- **Conclusion:** The passage concludes by affirming the completion of the debugging process and expresses the hope that the reader has gained a stronger understanding of debugging strategies. It also suggests that the experience provided insights into common errors encountered during debugging.
