# Import files into Python

Previously, you explored how to open files in Python, convert them into strings, and read them. In this reading, you'll review the syntax needed for this. You'll also focus on why the ability to work with files is important for security analysts using Python, and you will learn about writing files.

## Working with files in cybersecurity 

Security analysts may need to access a variety of files when working in Python. Many of these files will be logs. A **log** is a record of events that occur within an organization's systems.

For instance, there may be a log containing information on login attempts. This might be used to identify unusual activity that signals attempts made by a malicious actor to access the system.

As another example, malicious actors that have breached the system might be capable of attacking software applications. An analyst might need to access a log that contains information on software applications that are experiencing issues.

## Opening files in Python

To open a file called "update_log.txt" in Python for purposes of reading it, you can incorporate the following line of code:

```python
with open("update_log.txt", "r") as file:
```

This line consists of the with keyword, the open() function with its two parameters, and the as keyword followed by a variable name. You must place a colon (:) at the end of the line.

### with

The keyword with handles errors and manages external resources when used with other functions. In this case, it's used with the open() function in order to open a file. It will then manage the resources by closing the file after exiting the with statement.

**Note:** You can also use the open() function without the with keyword. However, you should close the file you opened to ensure proper handling of the file. 

### open()

The open() function opens a file in Python.

The first parameter identifies the file you want to open. In the following file structure, "update_log.txt" is located in the same directory as the Python file that will access it, "log_parser.ipynb":

![[Pasted image 20231122203049.png]]

Because they're in the same directory, only the name of the file is required. The code can be written as with open("update_log.txt", "r") as file:.

However, "access_log.txt" is not in the same directory as the Python file "log_parser.ipynb". Therefore, it's necessary to specify its absolute file path. A **file path** is the location of a file or directory. An absolute file path starts from the highest-level directory, the root. In the following code, the first parameter of the open() function includes the absolute file path to "access_log.txt":

```python
with open("/home/analyst/logs/access_log.txt", "r") as file:
```

**Note:** In Python, the names of files or their file paths can be handled as string data, and like all string data, you must place them in quotation marks.

The second parameter of the open() function indicates what you want to do with the file. In both of these examples, the second parameter is "r", which indicates that you want to read the file. Alternatively, you can use "w" if you want to write to a file or "a" if you want to append to a file.

### as

When you open a file using with open(), you must provide a variable that can store the file while you are within the with statement. You can do this through the keyword as followed by this variable name. The keyword as assigns a variable that references another object. The code with open("update_log.txt", "r") as file: assigns file to reference the output of the open() function within the indented code block that follows it.

## Reading files in Python

After you use the code with open("update_log.txt", "r") as file: to import "update_log.txt" into the file variable, you should indicate what to do with the file on the indented lines that follow it. For example, this code uses the .read() method to read the contents of the file:

```python
with open("update_log.txt", "r") as file:
    updates = file.read()
print(updates)
```

The .read() method converts files into strings. This is necessary in order to use and display the contents of the file that was read.

In this example, the file variable is used to generate a string of the file contents through .read(). This string is then stored in another variable called updates. After this, print(updates) displays the string.

Once the file is read into the updates string, you can perform the same operations on it that you might perform with any other string. For example, you could use the .index() method to return the index where a certain character or substring appears. Or, you could use len() to return the length of this string.

## Writing files in Python

Security analysts may also need to write to files. This could happen for a variety of reasons. For example, they might need to create a file containing the approved usernames on a new allow list. Or, they might need to edit existing files to add data or to adhere to policies for standardization.

To write to a file, you will need to open the file with "w" or "a" as the second argument of open(). 

You should use the "w" argument when you want to replace the contents of an existing file. When working with the existing file update_log.txt, the code with open("update_log.txt", "w") as file: opens it so that its contents can be replaced. 

Additionally, you can use the "w" argument to create a new file. For example, with open("update_log2.txt", "w") as file: creates and opens a new file called "update_log2.txt". 

You should use the "a" argument if you want to append new information to the end of an existing file rather than writing over it. The code with open("update_log.txt", "a") as file: opens "update_log.txt" so that new information can be appended to the end. Its existing information will not be deleted.

Like when opening a file to read from it, you should indicate what to do with the file on the indented lines that follow when you open a file to write to it. With both "w" and "a", you can use the .write() method. The .write() method writes string data to a specified file. 

The following example uses the .write() method to append the content of the line variable to the file "access_log.txt".

```python
line = "jrafael,192.168.243.140,4:56:27,True"
with open("access_log.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write(line)
```

**Note:** Calling the .write() method without using the with keyword when importing the file might result in its arguments not being completely written to the file if the file is not properly closed in another way.

## Key takeaways

It's important for security analysts to be able to import files into Python and then read from or write to them. Importing Python files involves using the with keyword, the open() function, and the as keyword. Reading from and writing to files requires knowledge of the .read() and .write() methods and the arguments to the open() function of "r", "w", and "a".

# Parse a text file in Python

- **Objective:** The passage aims to expand on the knowledge of working with text files in Python by introducing the concept of parsing. 
- **Parsing with the Split Method:** **[[Parsing]]** is described as the process of converting data into a more readable format. 
	- The method introduced for parsing in this context is the `.split()` method. It is explained that the `.split()` method converts a string into a list by separating the string based on a specified character. If no argument is passed, it separates the string based on whitespace. An example is provided, demonstrating how the split method can be used to convert a string into a list, making it easier to analyze.
- **Working with Security Log Example:** The passage then presents an example related to a security log where each line represents a new data point. To store these data points in a list, the `split` method is used without passing an argument, effectively splitting the text based on new lines. The resulting list of usernames is then printed, demonstrating the conversion.
- **Variable Assignment:** The importance of assigning the output of the split operation to a variable (e.g., `usernames`) is highlighted. This allows the list to be reused in other code.
- **Closing Message:** The passage concludes by congratulating the learner on learning the basics of parsing a text file in Python and provides a preview of upcoming videos, indicating a focus on techniques for working more in-depth with data in Python.
- **Overall Structure:** The passage follows a logical progression, starting with the explanation of parsing, introducing the `split` method, providing a specific example with security logs, and emphasizing the importance of variable assignment. The tone is instructive and encourages the learner to apply the concepts in upcoming videos.

# Work with files in Python

You previously explored how to open files in Python as well as how to read them and write to them. You also examined how to adjust the structure of file contents through the .split() method. In this reading, you'll review the .split() method, and you'll also learn an additional method that can help you work with file contents. 

## Parsing

Part of working with files involves structuring its contents to meet your needs. **[[Parsing]]** is the process of converting data into a more readable format. Data may need to become more readable in a couple of different ways. First, certain parts of your Python code may require modification into a specific format. By converting data into this format, you enable Python to process it in a specific way. Second, programmers need to read and interpret the results of their code, and parsing can also make the data more readable for them.

Methods that can help you parse your data include .split() and .join().

## .split()

### **The basics of .split()**

The .split() method converts a string into a list. It separates the string based on a specified character that's passed into .split() as an argument. 

In the following example, the usernames in the approved_users string are separated by a comma. For this reason, a string containing the comma (",") is passed into .split() in order to parse it into a list. Run this code and analyze the different contents of approved_users before and after the .split() method is applied to it:

```python
approved_users = "elarson,bmoreno,tshah,sgilmore,eraab"
print("before .split():", approved_users)

approved_users = approved_users.split(",")
print("after .split():", approved_users)
```
Output:
```python
before .split(): elarson,bmoreno,tshah,sgilmore,eraab
after .split(): ['elarson', 'bmoreno', 'tshah', 'sgilmore', 'eraab']
```

Before the .split() method is applied to approved_users, it contains a string, but after it is applied, this string is converted to a list.

If you do not pass an argument into .split(), it will separate the string every time it encounters a whitespace.

**Note:** A variety of characters are considered whitespaces by Python. These characters include spaces between characters, returns for new lines, and others.

The following example demonstrates how a string of usernames that are separated by space can be split into a list through the .split() method:

```python
removed_users = "wjaffrey jsoto abernard jhill awilliam"
print("before .split():", removed_users)

removed_users = removed_users.split()
print("after .split():", removed_users)
```
Output:
```python
before .split(): wjaffrey jsoto abernard jhill awilliam
after .split(): ['wjaffrey', 'jsoto', 'abernard', 'jhill', 'awilliam']
```

### **Applying .split() to files**

The .split() method allows you to work with file content as a list after you've converted it to a string through the .read() method. This is useful in a variety of ways. For example, if you want to iterate through the file contents in a for loop, this can be easily done when it's converted into a list.

The following code opens the "update_log.txt" file. It then reads all of the file contents into the updates variable as a string and splits the string in the updates variable into a list by creating a new element at each whitespace:

```python
with open("update_log.txt", "r") as file:
    updates = file.read()
updates = updates.split()
```

After this, through the updates variable, you can work with the contents of the "update_log.txt" file in parts of your code that require it to be structured as a list. 

**Note:** Because the line that contains .split() is not indented as part of the with statement, the file closes first. Closing a file as soon as it is no longer needed helps maintain code readability. Once a file is read into the updates variable, it is not needed and can be closed.

## .join()

### **The basics of .join()**

If you need to convert a list into a string, there is also a method for that. The .join() method concatenates the elements of an iterable into a string. The syntax used with .join() is distinct from the syntax used with .split() and other methods that you've worked with, such as .index(). 

In methods like .split() or .index(), you append the method to the string or list that you're working with and then pass in other arguments. For example, the code usernames.index(2), appends the .index() method to the variable usernames, which contains a list. It passes in 2 as the argument to indicate which element to return.

However, with .join(), you must pass the list that you want to concatenate into a string in as an argument. You append .join() to a character that you want to separate each element with once they are joined into a string.

For example, in the following code, the approved_users variable contains a list. If you want to join that list into a string and separate each element with a comma, you can use ",".join(approved_users). Run the code and examine what it returns:

```python
approved_users = ["elarson", "bmoreno", "tshah", "sgilmore", "eraab"]
print("before .join():", approved_users)

approved_users = ",".join(approved_users)
print("after .join():", approved_users)
```
Output:
```python
before .join(): ['elarson', 'bmoreno', 'tshah', 'sgilmore', 'eraab']
after .join(): elarson,bmoreno,tshah,sgilmore,eraab
```

Before .join() is applied, approved_users is a list of five elements. After it is applied, it is a string with each username separated by a comma.

**Note**: Another way to separate elements when using the .join() method is to use "\n", which is the newline character. The "\n" character indicates to separate the elements by placing them on new lines.

### **Applying .join() to files**

When working with files, it may also be necessary to convert its contents back into a string. For example, you may want to use the .write() method. The .write() method writes string data to a file. This means that if you have converted a file's contents into a list while working with it, you'll need to convert it back into a string before using .write(). You can use the .join() method for this.

You already examined how .split() could be applied to the contents of the "update_log.txt" file once it is converted into a string through .read() and stored as updates:

```python
with open("update_log.txt", "r") as file:
    updates = file.read()
updates = updates.split()
```

After you're through performing operations using the list in the updates variable, you might want to replace "update_log.txt" with the new contents. To do so, you need to first convert updates back into a string using .join(). Then, you can open the file using a with statement and use the .write() method to write the updates string to the file:

```python
updates = " ".join(updates)
with open("update_log.txt", "w") as file
    file.write(updates)`
```

The code " ".join(updates) indicates to separate each of the list elements in updates with a space once joined back into a string. And because "w" is specified as the second argument of open(), Python will overwrite the contents of "update_log.txt" with the string currently in the updates variable. 

## Key takeaways

An important element of working with files is being able to parse the data it contains. Parsing means converting the data into a readable format. The .split() and .join() methods are both useful for parsing data. The .split() method allows you to convert a string into a list, and the .join() method allows you to convert a list into a string.
