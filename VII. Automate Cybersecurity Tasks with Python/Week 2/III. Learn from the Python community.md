# Modules and libraries

- **Introduction to Built-in Functions and Libraries:**
	- The passage starts by revisiting the concept of built-in functions in Python, which are standard functions like print(), type(), and max(). It introduces the idea that additional pre-built functions can be accessed by importing libraries.
- **Libraries and Modules:**
	- Libraries are defined as collections of modules providing code that users can incorporate into their programs. Modules, in turn, are described as Python files containing functions, variables, classes, and runnable code. They are likened to saved Python files containing useful functionality, ranging from simple lines of code to complex and lengthy components.
- **Python Standard Library:**
	- The focus shifts to the Python Standard Library, characterized as an extensive collection of usable Python code often bundled with Python installations. Examples of modules from the Python Standard Library are highlighted, including the re module for pattern searching in log files, csv for efficient CSV file handling, glob and os for command line interaction, and time and datetime for timestamp operations.
- **External Libraries:**
	- The passage introduces the concept of external libraries, which can be downloaded and used in addition to the Python Standard Library. Examples such as Beautiful Soup for parsing HTML website files and NumPy for arrays and mathematical computations are provided. These external libraries are emphasized for their relevance to security analysts in tasks like network traffic analysis, log file parsing, and complex math.
- **Utility of Libraries and Modules:**
	- Python libraries and modules are highlighted as valuable resources that provide pre-programmed functions and variables, ultimately saving time for the user. The reader is encouraged to explore the discussed libraries and modules to understand their potential applications in Python programming, particularly in the context of security analysis.
- **Encouragement to Explore:**
	- The passage concludes by encouraging the reader to explore the discussed libraries and modules, emphasizing the ways in which they can be helpful in Python programming. This exploration is positioned as a means to enhance efficiency and productivity in working with Python.
