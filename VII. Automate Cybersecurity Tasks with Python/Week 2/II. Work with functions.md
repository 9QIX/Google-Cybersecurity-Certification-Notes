# Use parameters in functions

- **Introduction and Recap:**
	- The passage starts by revisiting the definition and execution of the first function, emphasizing that it didn't require external information. However, it sets the stage for discussing parameters in functions, highlighting the potential need for functions to accept external information.
- **Parameters in Functions:**
	- **[[Parameters]]** in Python functions are introduced as objects included in a function definition for internal use. They are accepted through the parentheses after the function name.
	- The example of the `range(start, stop)` function is revisited, emphasizing its use of parameters for start and stop indices.
- **Enhancing a Welcome Message Function:**
	- The need for personalized welcome messages is introduced. A new function, greet_employee(), is defined with a parameter for the employee's name.
	- The syntax involves placing the name parameter inside the parentheses. The function is designed to print a welcome message using the provided name.
- **Handling Variables in Print Statements:**
	- Considerations for incorporating the name variable into the print statement are discussed. A comma is used after "You're logged in," and the name variable is added. Since it's a variable, it's not placed in quotation marks.
- **Calling the Function with Arguments:**
	- The process of calling the greet_employee() function with a specific argument (Charley Patel) is explained. This is highlighted as an example of an argument, emphasizing that it is the data brought into a function when called.
- **Multiple Parameters in a Function:**
	- The concept of having more than one parameter in a function is introduced. An example is explored where parameters for first name and last name are included. Both parameters are separated by a comma when defining the function and are included as arguments when calling it.
- **Conclusion and Acknowledgment:**
	- The passage concludes by acknowledging the successful exploration of working with parameters in a function. The understanding gained is emphasized as crucial for continuing to write Python scripts. The reader is commended for their efforts in the learning process.
