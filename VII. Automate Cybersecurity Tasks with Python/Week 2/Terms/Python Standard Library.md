## The Python Standard Library

The **[[Python Standard Library]]** is an extensive collection of Python code that often comes packaged with Python. It includes a variety of modules, each with pre-built code centered around a particular type of task.Â 

For example, you were previously introduced to the the following modules in the Python Standard Library:

- The `re` module, which provides functions used for searching for patterns in log files
- The `csv` module, which provides functions used when working with .csv files
- The `glob` and `os` modules, which provide functions used when interacting with the command line
- The `time` and `datetime` modules, which provide functions used when working with timestamps

Another Python Standard Library module is `statistics`. The `statistics` module includes functions used when calculating `statistics` related to numeric data. For example, `mean()` is a function in the statistics module that takes numeric data as input and calculates its mean (or average). Additionally, `median()` is a function in the `statistics` module that takes numeric data as input and calculates its median (or middle value).
