- **Calling the Function with Arguments:**
	- The process of calling the `greet_employee()` function with a specific argument (Charley Patel) is explained. This is highlighted as an example of an **[[argument]]**, emphasizing that it is the data brought into a function when called.

### Arguments

In Python, an **[[argument]]** is the data brought into a function when it is called. When calling `remaining_login_attempts` in the following example, the integers 3 and 2 are considered arguments:

`remaining_login_attempts(3, 2)`

These integers pass into the function through the parameters that were identified when defining the function.Â In this case, those parameters would be maximum_attempts and total_attempts. 3 is in the first position, so it passes into maximum_attempts. Similarly, 2 is in the second position and passes into total_attempts.
