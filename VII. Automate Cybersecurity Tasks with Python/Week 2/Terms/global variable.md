### Global variables

A **[[global variable]]** is a variable that is available through the entire program. Global variables are assigned outside of a function definition. Whenever that variable is called, whether inside or outside a function, it will return the value it is assigned.

For example, you might assign the following variable at the beginning of your code:

`device_id = "7ad2130bd"`

Throughout the rest of your code, you will be able to access and modify the device_id variable in conditionals, loops, functions, and other syntax.
