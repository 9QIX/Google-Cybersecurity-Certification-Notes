# Conditional statements in Python

- **Introduction to Automation:** Automation is introduced as the use of technology to reduce human effort in performing common and repetitive tasks. It is highlighted as a means to allow computers to execute these tasks, freeing up time for other activities.
- **Conditional Statements:** Conditional statements are crucial for automation. They evaluate code to determine if it meets specified conditions. The keyword "if" is introduced as the initiator of a conditional statement. The structure involves specifying a condition followed by a colon, with the subsequent indented block being executed if the condition is true.
- **Operators in Conditional Statements:** Various operators are introduced for constructing conditions, including greater than, less than, equal to, not equal to, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to. The double equals sign (`==`) is emphasized for checking equality.
- **Example of If Statement:** An example is provided where Python is instructed to print an "account locked" message if the number of failed login attempts exceeds five. The syntax involves the use of the `if` keyword, specifying the condition, and defining the action in an indented block.
- **Comparison Operators:** Explanation and examples of comparison operators such as `==` and `!=` are provided. The importance of these operators in evaluating conditions is highlighted.
- **Example with Double Equals Sign:** An example is given where Python checks if a device's operating system matches a specific string, and if true, prints an "updates needed" message. The use of the double equals sign for equality comparison is demonstrated.
- **Else Statements:** The concept of the `else` keyword is introduced to handle scenarios where the initial condition in the `if` statement evaluates to false. The `else` block is executed in such cases.
- **Example with If-Else:** An example is provided where an `if` statement checks for a specific operating system. If true, it prints "updates needed"; otherwise, the `else` block is executed, printing "no updates needed."

Understanding conditional statements is fundamental to incorporating logic and decision-making into your Python code, enabling you to create more dynamic and responsive programs.
