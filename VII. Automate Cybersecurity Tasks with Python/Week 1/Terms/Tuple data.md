### **Tuple**

**[[Tuple data]]** is a data structure that consists of a collection of data that cannot be changed. Like lists, tuples can contain elements of varying data types.

A difference between tuple data and list data is that it is possible to change the elements in a list, but it is not possible to change the elements in a tuple. This could be useful in a cybersecurity context. For example, if software identifiers are stored in a tuple to ensure that they will not be altered, this can provide assurance that an access control list will only block the intended software.

The syntax of a tuple is also different from the syntax of a list. A tuple is placed in parentheses rather than brackets. These are all examples of the tuple data type:

- `("wjaffrey", "arutley", "dkot")`
- `(46, 2, 13, 2, 8, 0, 0)`
- `(True, False, True, True)`
- `("wjaffrey", 13, True)`

**Pro tip:** Tuples are more memory efficient than lists, so they are useful when you are working with a large quantity of data.
