**[[List data]]**: Data structure that consists of a collection of data in sequential form
## List data in a security setting

As a security analyst, you'll frequently work with lists in Python. **[[List data]]** is a data structure that consists of a collection of data in sequential form. You can use lists to store multiple elements in a single variable. A single list can contain multiple data types.Â 

In a cybersecurity context, lists might be used to store usernames, IP addresses, URLs, device IDs, and data.

Placing data within a list allows you to work with it in a variety of ways. For example, you might iterate through a list of device IDs using a for loop to perform the same actions for all items in the list. You could incorporate a conditional statement to only perform these actions if the device IDs meet certain conditions.

### Techniques for working with lists

**[[List data]]** is another common data type. Like with strings, you can use bracket notation to access a list element through its index. Several methods also help you with automation when working with lists. These include .insert(), .remove(), .append(), and .index().
