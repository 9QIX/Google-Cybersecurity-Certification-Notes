### **Dictionary**

**[[Dictionary data]]** is data that consists of one or more key-value pairs. Each key is mapped to a value. A colon (`:`) is placed between the key and value. Commas separate key-value pairs from other key-value pairs, and the dictionary is placed within curly brackets (`{}`). 

Dictionaries are useful when you want to store and retrieve data in a predictable way. For example, the following dictionary maps a building name to a number. The building name is the value, and the number is the key. A colon is placed after the key.

```
{ 1: "East",

  2: "West",

  3: "North",

  4: "South" }
```
