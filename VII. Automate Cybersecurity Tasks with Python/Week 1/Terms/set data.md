### **Set**

In Python, **[[set data]]** is data that consists of an unordered collection of unique values. This means no two values in a set can be the same.Â 

Elements in a set are always placed within curly brackets and are separated by a comma. These elements can be of any data type. This example of a set contains strings of usernames:

`{"jlanksy", "drosas", "nmason"}`
