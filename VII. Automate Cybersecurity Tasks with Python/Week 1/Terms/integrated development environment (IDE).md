## Integrated development environments (IDEs)

Another option for writing Python code is through an **[[integrated development environment (IDE)]],** or a software application for writing code that provides editing assistance and error correction tools. Integrated development environments include a graphical user interface (GUI) that provides programmers with a variety of options to customize and build their programs. 

### **Debuggers** 

In this course, you have been running code in a notebook environment. However, you may write Python code in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). An **[[Integrated Development Environment (IDE)]]** is a software application for writing code that provides editing assistance and error correction tools. Many IDEs offer error detection tools in the form of a debugger. A **[[debugger]]** is a software tool that helps to locate the source of an error and assess its causes.

In cases when you can't find the line of code that is causing the issue, debuggers help you narrow down the source of the error in your program. They do this by working with breakpoints. Breakpoints are markers placed on certain lines of executable code that indicate which sections of code should run when debugging.

Some debuggers also have a feature that allows you to check the values stored in variables as they change throughout your code. This is especially helpful for logic errors so that you can locate where variable values have unintentionally changed.
