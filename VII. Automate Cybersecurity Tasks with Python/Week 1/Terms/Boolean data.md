## Boolean 

**[[Boolean data]]** is data that can only be one of two values: either `True` or `False`.

You should not place Boolean values in quotation marks. When you run the following code, it displays the Boolean value of `True`:

```python
print(True)
```
Output:
```python
True
```

You can also return a Boolean value by comparing numbers. Because `9` is not greater than `10`, this code evaluates to `False`:

```python
print(9 > 10)
```
Output:
```python
False
```
