**Iterative Statements and Loops:** **[[Iterative statement]]** involve code that repeatedly executes a set of instructions, and loops are a way to achieve this in Python. Loops allow you to repeat a line of code without typing it multiple times.

# More on loops in Python

Previously, you explored iterative statements. An **[[iterative statement]]** is code that repeatedly executes a set of instructions. Depending on the criteria, iterative statements execute zero or more times. We iterated through code using both for loops and while loops. In this reading, you’ll recap the syntax of loops. Then, you'll learn how to use the break and continue keywords to control the execution of loops. 

### Iterative statements

An **[[iterative statement]]** is code that repeatedly executes a set of instructions. You explored two kinds of iterative statements: for loops and while loops. In both cases, they allow you to perform the same actions a certain number of times without the need to retype the same code each time. Using a for loop allows you to automate repetition of that code based on a sequence, and using a while loop allows you to automate the repetition based on a condition.
