**Iterative Statements and Loops:** **[[Iterative statement]]** involve code that repeatedly executes a set of instructions, and loops are a way to achieve this in Python. Loops allow you to repeat a line of code without typing it multiple times.

# More on loops in Python

Previously, you explored iterative statements. An **[[iterative statement]]** is code that repeatedly executes a set of instructions. Depending on the criteria, iterative statements execute zero or more times. We iterated through code using both for loops and while loops. In this reading, you’ll recap the syntax of loops. Then, you'll learn how to use the break and continue keywords to control the execution of loops.
