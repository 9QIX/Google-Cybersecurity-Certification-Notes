### **Integer**

In Python, **[[integer data]]** is data consisting of a number that does not include a decimal point. These are all examples of integer data:

- `-100 `
- `-12`
- `-1`
- `0`
- `1`
- `20`
- `500 `

Integers are not placed in quotation marks. You can use the `print()` function to display an integer. When you run this code, it displays `5`:

```python
print(5)
```
Output:
```python
5
```

You can also use the `print()` function to perform mathematical operations with integers. For example, this code adds two integers:

```python
print(5 + 2)
```
Output:
```python
7
```

The result is `7`. You can also subtract, multiply, or divide two integers.
