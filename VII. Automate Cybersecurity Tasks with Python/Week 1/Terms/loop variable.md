- **Loop Variable:** The **[[loop variable]]**, often named 'i' (though any name can be used), controls the iterations of the loop. It is only used within the loop and not outside of it.
	- **Range Function:** The `range` function is introduced as a way to generate a sequence of numbers. It starts from a specified number (defaulting to zero if not provided) and stops before a specified number. The sequence generated by `range` can be used to control the number of iterations in a for loop.
	- **Example with Range Function:** An example is provided where a for loop is used with the `range` function to repeat a specific process (printing an error message) 10 times. The benefits of using a loop in this scenario, as opposed to manually typing the error message multiple times, are highlighted.
