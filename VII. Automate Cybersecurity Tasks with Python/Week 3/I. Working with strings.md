# String operations

- **[[String Data]]:** The passage begins by emphasizing the importance of working with string data in security, particularly when dealing with usernames and login information.
	- **Refresher on Strings:** A quick refresher on strings is provided, defining them as an ordered sequence of characters in Python, written within quotation marks. Examples of strings using double quotation marks are given: "Hello", "123", and "Number 1!"
- **Variables and String Function:** The concept of variables is revisited, demonstrating the variable `my_string` storing the string "security." The introduction of the string function is highlighted, explaining its role in converting other data types, such as integers or floats, into strings. This conversion allows performing tasks specific to strings.
- **Converting Integer to String (`str()`):** The process of converting an integer to a string using the string function is demonstrated. The example involves applying the string function to the integer 123, resulting in the variable `new_string` containing a string with the characters 1, 2, and 3.
- **Basic String Operations:** The passage transitions to basic string operations, starting with the length function. The length function is described as returning the number of elements in an object, particularly useful for determining the length of strings. An example involving IP addresses and their maximum length is provided.
	- **String Length Example (`len()`):** The use of the length function to print the length of the string "Hello" is demonstrated. The length function is nested within the print function to calculate and display the number of characters in the string.
	- **String Concatenation:** **[[String concatenation]]**, achieved through the addition operator (+), is introduced as the process of joining two strings together. An example concatenating "Hello" and "world" is provided. The limitations of certain operators, such as subtraction, for strings are mentioned.
- **String Methods:** The concept of string **[[method]]** is explained as functions belonging to a specific data type, such as strings. It is noted that methods appear after the string and are specific to the data type. The upper and lower methods are introduced as common string methods.
	- **Upper Method Example (`.upper()`):** The upper method, which returns a copy of the string in all uppercase letters, is applied to the string "Hello." The syntax of using methods is highlighted, with the period (dot) separating the string and the method.
	- **Lower Method Example (`.lower()`):** The lower method, returning a copy of the string in all lowercase letters, is demonstrated on the "Hello" string. The need to use a print function to output the results is emphasized.
- **Conclusion:** The passage concludes with the successful execution of the upper and lower methods, showcasing the string "HELLO" in uppercase and "hello" in lowercase, respectively. The reader is now equipped with knowledge about working with string data and performing basic operations in Python.
