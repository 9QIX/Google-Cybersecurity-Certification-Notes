- **Introduction to Regular Expressions (Regex):** Introduces the concept of **[[regular expressions (regex)]]**, defining them as sequences of characters forming patterns. Emphasizes their use in searching within log files and highlights their capability to search for various patterns, such as specific prefixes or lengths, in a security context.
	- **Application of Regex in Security:** Provides examples of how regex can be applied in a security context, such as efficiently searching for specific IP address patterns or extracting email addresses from log files without prior knowledge of the exact addresses.

## Basics of regular expressions

A **[[regular expression (regex)]]** is a sequence of characters that forms a pattern. You can use these in Python to search for a variety of patterns. This could include IP addresses, emails, or device IDs.

To access regular expressions and related functions in Python, you need to import the re module first. You should use the following line of code to import the re module:

`import re`
