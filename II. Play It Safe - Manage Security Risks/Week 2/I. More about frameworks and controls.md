- **[[Security frameworks]]** are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy, such as social engineering attacks and ransomware. 
	- Security involves more than just the virtual space. It also includes the physical, which is why many organizations have plans to maintain safety in the work environment. For example, access to a building may require using a key card or badge. 
	- Frameworks are used to create plans to address security risks, threats, and vulnerabilities, controls are used to reduce specific risks. If proper controls are not in place, an organization could face significant financial impacts and damage to their reputation because of exposure to risks including trespassing, creating fake employee accounts, or providing free benefits. 

- **[[Security controls]]** are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. In this video, we'll discuss three common types of controls: 
	- **[[Encryption]]** - is the process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format. Typically, encryption involves converting data from plaintext to ciphertext. 
		- **[[Ciphertext]]** is the raw, encoded message that's unreadable to humans and computers. Ciphertext data cannot be read until it's been decrypted into its original plaintext form. Encryption is used to ensure confidentiality of sensitive data, such as customers' account information or social security numbers. 
	- **[[Authentication]]** - is the process of verifying who someone or something is. 
		- A real-world example of authentication is logging into a website with your username and password. This basic form of authentication proves that you know the username and password and should be allowed to access the website. 
		- More advanced methods of authentication, such as multi-factor authentication, or MFA, challenge the user to demonstrate that they are who they claim to be by requiring both a password and an additional form of authentication, like a security code or biometrics, such as a fingerprint, voice, or face scan. 
			- **[[Biometrics]]** are unique physical characteristics that can be used to verify a person's identity. 
				- Examples of biometrics are a fingerprint, an eye scan, or a palm scan. One example of a social engineering attack that can exploit biometrics is vishing. **[[Vishing]]** is the exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source. For example, vishing could be used to impersonate a person's voice to steal their identity and then commit a crime. 
	- **[[Authorization]]** - refers to the concept of granting access to specific resources within a system. Essentially, authorization is used to verify that a person has permission to access a resource. 
		- As an example, if you're working as an entry-level security analyst for the federal government, you could have permission to access data through the deep web or other internal data that is only accessible if you're a federal employee. 

# The relationship between frameworks and controls

Previously, you learned how organizations use security frameworks and controls to protect against threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. This included discussions about the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST’s) Risk Management Framework (RMF) and Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad. In this reading, you will further explore security frameworks and controls and how they are used together to help mitigate organizational risk.

## Frameworks and controls

**[[Security frameworks]]** are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy. 
	Frameworks support organizations’ ability to adhere to compliance laws and regulations. 
		For example, the healthcare industry uses frameworks to comply with the United States’ Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires that medical professionals keep patient information safe.

**[[Security controls]]** are safeguards designed to reduce _specific_ security risks. Security controls are the measures organizations use to lower risk and threats to data and privacy. 
	For example, a control that can be used alongside frameworks to ensure a hospital remains compliant with HIPAA is requiring that patients use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access their medical records. Using a measure like MFA to validate someone’s identity is one way to help mitigate potential risks and threats to private data.

## Specific frameworks and controls

There are many different frameworks and controls that organizations can use to remain compliant with regulations and achieve their security goals. Frameworks covered in this reading are the **Cyber Threat Framework (CTF) and the International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001**. Several common security controls, used alongside these types of frameworks, are also explained. 

### **[[Cyber Threat Framework (CTF)]]**

According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the CTF was developed by the U.S. government to provide “a common language for describing and communicating information about cyber threat activity.” By providing a common language to communicate information about threat activity, the CTF helps cybersecurity professionals analyze and share information more efficiently. This allows organizations to improve their response to the constantly evolving cybersecurity landscape and threat actors' many tactics and techniques.

### **[[International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO-IEC) 27001]]**

An internationally recognized and used framework is ISO/IEC 27001. The ISO 27000 family of standards enables organizations of all sectors and sizes to manage the security of assets, such as **financial information, intellectual property, employee data, and information entrusted to third parties**. This framework outlines requirements for an information security management system, best practices, and controls that support an organization’s ability to manage risks. Although the ISO/IEC 27001 framework does not require the use of specific controls, it does provide a collection of controls that organizations can use to improve their security posture.

### **Controls**

[[Controls]] are used alongside frameworks to reduce the possibility and impact of a security threat, risk, or vulnerability. Controls can be physical, technical, and administrative and are typically used to prevent, detect, or correct security issues.

Examples of physical controls:
- Gates, fences, and locks
- Security guards
- Closed-circuit television (CCTV), surveillance cameras, and motion detectors
- Access cards or badges to enter office spaces

Examples of technical controls:
- Firewalls
- MFA
- Antivirus software

Examples of administrative controls:
- Separation of duties
- Authorization
- Asset classification

To learn more about controls, particularly those used to protect health-related assets from a variety of threat types, review the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ [Physical Access Control presentation](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/physical-access-control.pdf). 

## Key takeaways

Cybersecurity frameworks and controls are used together to establish an organization’s security posture. They also support an organization’s ability to meet security goals and comply with laws and regulations. Although these frameworks and controls are typically voluntary, organizations are strongly encouraged to implement and use them to help ensure the safety of critical assets.
