- ## **[[Defense in Depth]]**
	- Defense in depth means that ***an organization should have multiple security controls that address risks and threats in different ways***. 
	- One example of a security control is multi-factor authentication, or MFA, which requires users to take an additional step beyond simply entering their username and password to gain access to an application. 
	- Other controls include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and permission settings that can be used to create multiple points of defense, a threat actor must get through to breach an organization. 

**Layered Defense:** **[[Defense in Depth]]** is a security model based on the idea of layered defense. In this model, multiple layers of security controls are implemented to protect assets. If one layer fails, another takes its place to thwart an attack.
