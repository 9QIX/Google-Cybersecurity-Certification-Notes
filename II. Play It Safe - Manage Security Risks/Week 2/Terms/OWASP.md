## The OWASP Top 10

One of OWASP’s most valuable resources is the OWASP Top 10. The organization has published this list since 2003 as a way to spread awareness of the web’s most targeted vulnerabilities. The Top 10 mainly applies to new or custom made software. Many of the world's largest organizations reference the OWASP Top 10 during application development to help ensure their programs address common security mistakes.

**Pro tip:** OWASP’s Top 10 is updated every few years as technologies evolve. Rankings are based on how often the vulnerabilities are discovered and the level of risk they present.

**Note:** Auditors also use the OWASP Top 10 as one point of reference when checking for regulatory compliance.
