The [[Principle of Least Privilege]] limits users' access to only the information they need to complete work-related tasks. Limiting access is one way of maintaining the confidentiality and security of private data.Â 

- ## **[[Principle of Least Privilege]]**
	- The principle of least privilege means making sure that ***users have the least amount of access required to perform their everyday tasks***. 
	- The main reason for limiting access to organizational information and resources is to reduce the amount of damage a security breach could cause. 
	- For example, as an entry-level analyst, you may have access to log data, but may not have access to change user permissions. Therefore, if a threat actor compromises your credentials, they'll only be able to gain limited access to digital or physical assets, which may not be enough for them to deploy their intended attack.  

## Changing permissions

The **[[principle of least privilege]]** is the concept of granting only the *minimal access and authorization required to complete a task or function*. In other words, users should not have privileges that are beyond what is necessary. Not following the principle of least privilege can create security risks.

The `chmod` command can help you manage this authorization. The `chmod` command changes permissions on files and directories.
