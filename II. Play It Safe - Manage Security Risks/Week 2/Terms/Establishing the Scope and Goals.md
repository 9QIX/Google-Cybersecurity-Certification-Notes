**[[Establishing the Scope and Goals]]** (Planning Process)
	- **[[Scope]]** refers to the specific criteria of an internal security audit. Scope requires organizations to identify people, assets, policies, procedures, and technologies that might impact an organization's security posture. 
	- **[[Goals]]** are an outline of the organization's security objectives, or what they want to achieve in order to improve their security posture. 
	- As an example, the scope of this audit involves assessing user permissions; identifying existing controls, policies, and procedures; and accounting for the technology currently in use by the organization. The goals outlined include implementing core functions of frameworks, like the NIST CSF; establishing policies and procedures to ensure compliance; and strengthening system controls.
