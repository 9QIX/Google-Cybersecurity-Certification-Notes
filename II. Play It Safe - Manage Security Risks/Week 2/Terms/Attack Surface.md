 An **[[Attack Surface]]** refers to all the potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit, like attack vectors, which are pathways attackers use to penetrate security defenses. 


### Attack surface 

**[[Cloud service providers (CSPs)]]** offer numerous applications and services for organizations at a low cost. 

Every service or application on a network carries its own set of risks and vulnerabilities and increases an organization’s overall **[[attack surface]]**. An increased attack surface must be compensated for with increased security measures.

Cloud networks that utilize many services introduce lots of entry points into an organization’s network. However, if the network is designed correctly, utilizing several services does not introduce more entry points into an organization’s network design. These entry points can be used to introduce malware onto the network and pose other security vulnerabilities. It is important to note that CSPs often defer to more secure options, and have undergone more scrutiny than a traditional on-premises network. 

- **[[Attack Surface]]:** An attack surface refers to all the potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit. Analyzing the attack surface is often the first step taken by security teams in enhancing an organization's defenses.
	- **Castle Analogy:** The video provides an analogy by comparing the role of a security team at an old castle. The team must allocate resources to defend the castle effectively. While the castle's giant walls, stone towers, and wooden gates are common security controls, they might not cover all possible attack scenarios. For instance, if the castle is located near the ocean, it could be vulnerable to attacks by ships. In this case, the security team should equip the castle with catapults to address this specific threat.
	- **Modern Organizations:** Modern organizations need to consider both physical and digital attack surfaces. The **[[physical attack surface]]** includes people and their devices, which can be targeted from both inside and outside the organization. For example, an unattended laptop in a public space can be vulnerable to external threats, such as competitors or internal threats, like disgruntled employees. Security hardening is the process of strengthening a system to reduce its vulnerabilities and attack surface, often accomplished by placing obstacles to deter attacks.
