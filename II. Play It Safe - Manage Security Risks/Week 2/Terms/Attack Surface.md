 An **[[Attack Surface]]** refers to all the potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit, like attack vectors, which are pathways attackers use to penetrate security defenses. 


### Attack surface 

**[[Cloud service providers (CSPs)]]** offer numerous applications and services for organizations at a low cost. 

Every service or application on a network carries its own set of risks and vulnerabilities and increases an organization’s overall **[[attack surface]]**. An increased attack surface must be compensated for with increased security measures.

Cloud networks that utilize many services introduce lots of entry points into an organization’s network. However, if the network is designed correctly, utilizing several services does not introduce more entry points into an organization’s network design. These entry points can be used to introduce malware onto the network and pose other security vulnerabilities. It is important to note that CSPs often defer to more secure options, and have undergone more scrutiny than a traditional on-premises network.
