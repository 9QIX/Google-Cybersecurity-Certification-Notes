[[Controls]] are used alongside frameworks to reduce the possibility and impact of a security threat, risk, or vulnerability. Controls can be physical, technical, and administrative and are typically used to prevent, detect, or correct security issues.

Examples of physical controls:

- Gates, fences, and locks
- Security guards
- Closed-circuit television (CCTV), surveillance cameras, and motion detectors
- Access cards or badges to enter office spaces

Examples of technical controls:

- Firewalls
- MFA
- Antivirus software

Examples of administrative controls:

- Separation of duties
- Authorization
- Asset classification

To learn more about controls, particularly those used to protect health-related assets from a variety of threat types, review the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ [Physical Access Control presentation](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/physical-access-control.pdf).
