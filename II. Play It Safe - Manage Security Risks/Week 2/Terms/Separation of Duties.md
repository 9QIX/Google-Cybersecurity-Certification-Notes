- ## **[[Separation of Duties]]**
	- Another principle is separation of duties, which can be used to prevent individuals from carrying out fraudulent or illegal activities. This principle means that ***no one should be given so many privileges that they can misuse the system***. 
	- For example, the person in a company who signs the paychecks shouldn't also be the person who prepares them. 

**Note:** Least privilege is closely related to another fundamental security principle, the **[[separation of duties]]**â€”a security concept that divides tasks and responsibilities among different users to prevent giving a single user complete control over critical business functions.
