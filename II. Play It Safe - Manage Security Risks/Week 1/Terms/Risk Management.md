**[[Risk Management]]** - There are several areas of focus for this domain: defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and legal regulations. By defining security goals and objectives, organizations can reduce risks to critical assets and data like PII, or personally identifiable information. 

## Risk management

A primary goal of organizations is to protect assets. An **[[asset]]** is an item perceived as having value to an organization. Assets can be digital or physical. Examples of digital assets include the personal information of employees, clients, or vendors, such as: 
- Social Security Numbers (SSNs), or unique national identification numbers assigned to individuals 
- Dates of birth
- Bank account numbers
- Mailing addresses

Examples of physical assets include:
- Payment kiosks
- Servers
- Desktop computers
- Office spaces

Some common strategies used to manage risks include:
- **[[Acceptance]]**: Accepting a risk to avoid disrupting business continuity
- **[[Avoidance]]**: Creating a plan to avoid the risk altogether
- **[[Transference]]**: Transferring risk to a third party to manage
- **[[Mitigation]]**: Lessening the impact of a known risk
