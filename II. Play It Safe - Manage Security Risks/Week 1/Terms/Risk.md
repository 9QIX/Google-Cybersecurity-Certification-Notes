- A **[[Risk]]** is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. Think of a risk as the likelihood of a threat occurring. 
	An example of a risk to an organization might be the lack of backup protocols for making sure its stored information can be recovered in the event of an accident or security incident. 
	- Organizations tend to rate risks at different levels: low, medium, and high, depending on possible threats and the value of an asset.
		- A **[[Low-Risk Asset]]** is information that would not harm the organization's reputation or ongoing operations, and would not cause financial damage if compromised. 
			- This includes public information such as website content, or published research data.
		- A **[[Medium-Risk Asset]]** might include information that's not available to the public and may cause some damage to the organization's finances, reputation, or ongoing operations. 
			- For example, the early release of a company's quarterly earnings could impact the value of their stock.
		- A **[[High-Risk Asset]]** is any information protected by regulations or laws, which if compromised, would have a severe negative impact on an organization's finances, ongoing operations, or reputation. 
			- This could include leaked assets with SPII, PII, or intellectual property.
