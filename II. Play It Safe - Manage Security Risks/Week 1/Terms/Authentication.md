**[[Authentication]]** - is the process of verifying who someone or something is. 
	- A real-world example of authentication is logging into a website with your username and password. This basic form of authentication proves that you know the username and password and should be allowed to access the website. 
	- More advanced methods of authentication, such as multi-factor authentication, or MFA, challenge the user to demonstrate that they are who they claim to be by requiring both a password and an additional form of authentication, like a security code or biometrics, such as a fingerprint, voice, or face scan.

- **[[Authentication]]:** Authentication is the first component of access controls. It serves the purpose of verifying the identity of individuals or systems attempting to access information by asking, "Who are you?" Authentication relies on three factors:
	- **[[Knowledge]]:** Authentication by knowledge involves something the user knows, such as a password or a security question answer.
	- **[[Ownership]]:** Authentication by ownership pertains to something the user possesses, such as a one-time passcode (OTP) sent via text or email.
	- **[[Characteristic]]:** Authentication by characteristic is based on something the user is, such as biometrics like fingerprint or facial scans.
