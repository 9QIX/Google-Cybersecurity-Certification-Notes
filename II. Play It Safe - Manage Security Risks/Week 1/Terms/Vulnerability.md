- **[[Vulnerability]]** is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat. ***And it's worth noting that both a vulnerability and threat must be present for there to be a risk***. 
	- Examples of vulnerabilities include: an outdated firewall, software, or application; weak passwords; or unprotected confidential data. 
	- People can also be considered a vulnerability. People's actions can significantly affect an organization's internal network. Whether it's a client, external vendor, or employee, maintaining security must be a united effort.
	- So entry-level analysts need to educate and empower people to be more security conscious. For example, educating people on how to identify a phishing email is a great starting point. Using access cards to grant employee access to physical spaces while restricting outside visitors is another good security measure.

**[[Vulnerability]]:** Vulnerabilities are weaknesses that can be exploited by potential threats. The term "can" is crucial in this context, indicating the potential for exploitation.
