# Threat, risks and vulnerabilities

[[Asset]] is an item perceived as having value to an organization. During their lifespan, organizations acquire all types of assets, including physical office spaces, computers, customers' PII, intellectual property, such as patents or copyrighted data, and so much more. Unfortunately, organizations operate in an environment that presents multiple security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities to their assets.

Let's review what threats, risks, and vulnerabilities are and discuss some common examples of each:

- A **[[threat]]** is any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets. One example of a threat is a social engineering attack.
  - [[Social engineering]] is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Malicious links in email messages that look like they're from legitimate companies or people is one method of social engineering known as phishing. As a reminder, phishing is a technique that is used to acquire sensitive data, such as user names, passwords, or banking information.
- A **[[Risk]]** is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. Think of a risk as the likelihood of a threat occurring.
  An example of a risk to an organization might be the lack of backup protocols for making sure its stored information can be recovered in the event of an accident or security incident.
  - Organizations tend to rate risks at different levels: low, medium, and high, depending on possible threats and the value of an asset.
    - A **[[Low-Risk Asset]]** is information that would not harm the organization's reputation or ongoing operations, and would not cause financial damage if compromised.
      - This includes public information such as website content, or published research data.
    - A **[[Medium-Risk Asset]]** might include information that's not available to the public and may cause some damage to the organization's finances, reputation, or ongoing operations.
      - For example, the early release of a company's quarterly earnings could impact the value of their stock.
    - A **[[High-Risk Asset]]** is any information protected by regulations or laws, which if compromised, would have a severe negative impact on an organization's finances, ongoing operations, or reputation.
      - This could include leaked assets with SPII, PII, or intellectual property.
- **[[Vulnerability]]** is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat. **_And it's worth noting that both a vulnerability and threat must be present for there to be a risk_**.
  - Examples of vulnerabilities include: an outdated firewall, software, or application; weak passwords; or unprotected confidential data.
  - People can also be considered a vulnerability. People's actions can significantly affect an organization's internal network. Whether it's a client, external vendor, or employee, maintaining security must be a united effort.
  - So entry-level analysts need to educate and empower people to be more security conscious. For example, educating people on how to identify a phishing email is a great starting point. Using access cards to grant employee access to physical spaces while restricting outside visitors is another good security measure.

# Key impacts of threats, risks and vulnerabilities

- **[[Ransomware]]** is a malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data then demand payment to restore access.
  - Once ransomware is deployed by an attacker, it can freeze network systems, leave devices unusable, and encrypt, or lock confidential data, making devices inaccessible. The [[threat actor]] then demands a ransom before providing a decryption key to allow organizations to return to their normal business operations. Think of a decryption key as a password provided to regain access to your data. Note that when ransom negotiations occur or data is leaked by threat actors, these events can occur through the dark web.

## Three layers of the web

- The **[[Surface Web]]** is the layer that most people use. It contains content that can be accessed using a web browser.
- The **[[Deep Web]]** Generally requires authorization to access it. An organization's intranet is an example of the deep web, since it can only be accessed by employees or others who have been granted access.
- The **[[Dark Web]]** can only be accessed by using special software. The dark web generally carries a negative connotation since it is the preferred web layer for criminals because of the secrecy that it provides.

## Three key impacts of threats, risks and vulnerabilities

- **[[Financial Impact]]** - When an organization's assets are compromised by an attack, such as the use of malware, the financial consequences can be significant for a variety of reasons. These can include interrupted production and services, the cost to correct the issue, and fines if assets are compromised because of non-compliance with laws and regulations.
- **[[Identity Theft]]** - Organizations must decide whether to store private customer, employee, and outside vendor data, and for how long. Storing any type of sensitive data presents a risk to the organization.
  - Sensitive data can include personally identifiable information, or PII, which can be sold or leaked through the dark web. That's because the dark web provides a sense of secrecy and threat actors may have the ability to sell data there without facing legal consequences.
- **[[Damage to an Organization's Reputation]]** - A solid customer base supports an organization's mission, vision, and financial goals. An exploited vulnerability can lead customers to seek new business relationships with competitors or create bad press that causes permanent damage to an organization's reputation.
  - The loss of customer data doesn't only affect an organization's reputation and financials, it may also result in legal penalties and fines. Organizations are strongly encouraged to take proper security measures and follow certain protocols to prevent the significant impact of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. By using all the tools in their toolkit, security teams are better prepared to handle an event such as a ransomware attack.

# NISTâ€™s Risk Management Framework

1. **[[Prepare]]** refers to activities that are necessary to manage security and privacy risks before a breach occurs.
   - As an entry-level analyst, you'll likely use this step to monitor for risks and identify controls that can be used to reduce those risks.
2. **[[Categorize]]**, which is used to develop risk management processes and tasks. Security professionals then use those processes and develop tasks by thinking about how the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and information can be impacted by risk.
   - As an entry-level analyst, you'll need to be able to understand how to follow the processes established by your organization to reduce risks to critical assets, such as private customer information.
3. **[[Select]]** means to choose, customize, and capture documentation of the controls that protect an organization.
   - An example of the select step would be keeping a playbook up-to-date or helping to manage other documentation that allows you and your team to address issues more efficiently.
4. **[[Implement]]** security and privacy plans for the organization. Having good plans in place is essential for minimizing the impact of ongoing security risks.
   - For example, if you notice a pattern of employees constantly needing password resets, implementing a change to password requirements may help solve this issue.
5. **[[Assess]]** means to determine if established controls are implemented correctly. An organization always wants to operate as efficiently as possible. So it's essential to take the time to analyze whether the implemented protocols, procedures, and controls that are in place are meeting organizational needs.
   - During this step, analysts identify potential weaknesses and determine whether the organization's tools, procedures, controls, and protocols should be changed to better manage potential risks.
6. **[[Authorize]]** means being accountable for the security and privacy risks that may exist in an organization.
   - As an analyst, the authorization step could involve generating reports, developing plans of action, and establishing project milestones that are aligned to your organization's security goals.
7. **[[Monitor]]** means to be aware of how systems are operating. Assessing and maintaining technical operations are tasks that analysts complete daily. Part of maintaining a low level of risk for an organization is knowing how the current systems support the organization's security goals. If the systems in place don't meet those goals, changes may be needed.
