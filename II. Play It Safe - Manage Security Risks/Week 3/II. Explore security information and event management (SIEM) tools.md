# Different types SIEM tools:

- ### **Self-hosted SIEM tools**
	- [[Self-hosted SIEM tools]] require organizations to install, operate, and maintain the tool using their own physical infrastructure, such as server capacity. These applications are then managed and maintained by the organization's IT department, rather than a third party vendor. 
	- Self-hosted SIEM tools are ideal when an organization is required to maintain physical control over confidential data.
- ### **Cloud-hosted SIEM tools** 
	- Alternatively, [[Cloud-hosted SIEM tools]] are maintained and managed by the SIEM providers, making them accessible through the internet. 
	- Cloud-hosted SIEM tools are ideal for organizations that don't want to invest in creating and maintaining their own infrastructure. 
- ### **Hybrid SIEM solution**
	- Or, an organization can choose to use a combination of both self-hosted and cloud-hosted SIEM tools, known as a hybrid solution. Organizations might choose a [[Hybrid SIEM solution]] to leverage the benefits of the cloud while also maintaining physical control over confidential data. 
- Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud, and Chronicle are common SIEM tools that many organizations use to help protect their data and systems.

## Common SIEM tools:

Splunk is a data analysis platform and Splunk Enterprise provides SIEM solutions.

- ### **Splunk Enterprise** 
	- A self-hosted tool used to ***retain, analyze, and search an organization's log data*** to provide security information and alerts in real-time.
- ### **Splunk Cloud** 
	- A cloud-hosted tool used to ***collect, search, and monitor log data***. Splunk Cloud is helpful for organizations running hybrid or cloud-only environments, where some or all of the organization's services are in the cloud. 
- ### **Chronicle**
	-  A cloud-native tool designed to ***retain, analyze, and search data***. Chronicle provides log monitoring, data analysis, and data collection. 
	- Like cloud-hosted tools, cloud-native tools are also fully maintained and managed by the vendor. But cloud-native tools are specifically designed to take full advantage of cloud computing capabilities such as availability, flexibility, and scalability. 
- Because threat actors are frequently improving their strategies to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their targets, it's important for organizations to use a variety of security tools to help defend against attacks. 

# More about cybersecurity tools

Previously, you learned about several tools that are used by cybersecurity team members to monitor for and identify potential security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. In this reading, you’ll learn more about common open-source and proprietary cybersecurity tools that you may use as a cybersecurity professional.

## Open-source tools

**[[Open-source tools]]** are often free to use and can be user friendly. The objective of open-source tools is to provide users with software that is built by the public in a collaborative way, which can result in the software being more secure. Additionally, open-source tools allow for more customization by users, resulting in a variety of new services built from the same open-source software package. 

Software engineers create open-source projects to improve software and make it available for anyone to use, as long as the specified license is respected. The source code for open-source projects is readily available to users, as well as the training material that accompanies them. Having these sources readily available allows users to modify and improve project materials. 

## Proprietary tools

**[[Proprietary tools]]** are developed and owned by a person or company, and users typically pay a fee for usage and training. The owners of proprietary tools are the only ones who can access and modify the source code. This means that users generally need to wait for updates to be made to the software, and at times they might need to pay a fee for those updates. Proprietary software generally allows users to modify a limited number of features to meet individual and organizational needs. Examples of proprietary tools include Splunk® and Chronicle SIEM tools.

### **Common misconceptions**

There is a common misconception that open-source tools are less effective and not as safe to use as proprietary tools. However, developers have been creating open-source materials for years that have become industry standards. Although it is true that threat actors have attempted to manipulate open-source tools, because these tools are open source it is actually harder for people with malicious intent to successfully cause harm. The wide exposure and immediate access to the source code by well-intentioned and informed users and professionals makes it less likely for issues to occur, because they can fix issues as soon as they’re identified.  

## Examples of open-source tools

In security, there are many tools in use that are open-source and commonly available. Two examples are Linux and Suricata.

### **Linux**

**[[Linux]]** is an open-source operating system that is widely used. It allows you to tailor the operating system to your needs using a command-line interface. An **operating system** is the interface between computer hardware and the user. It’s used to communicate with the hardware of a computer and manage software applications. 

There are multiple versions of Linux that exist to accomplish specific tasks. Linux and its command-line interface will be discussed in detail, later in the certificate program. 

### **Suricata**

[[Suricata]] is an open-source network analysis and threat detection software. Network analysis and threat detection software is used to inspect network traffic to identify suspicious behavior and generate network data logs. The detection software finds activity across users, computers, or Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to help uncover potential threats, risks, or vulnerabilities. 

Suricata was developed by the [[Open Information Security Foundation (OISF)]]. OISF is dedicated to maintaining open-source use of the Suricata project to ensure it’s free and publicly available. Suricata is widely used in the public and private sector, and it integrates with many SIEM tools and other security tools. Suricata will also be discussed in greater detail later in the program.

## Key takeaways

Open-source tools are widely used in the cybersecurity profession. Throughout the certificate program, you will have multiple opportunities to learn about and explore both open-source and proprietary tools in more depth.
