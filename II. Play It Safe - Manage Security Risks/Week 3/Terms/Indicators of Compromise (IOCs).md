It identifies suspicious domain names in logs, known as [[Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)]]

**[[Indicators of compromise (IoCs)]]** are observable evidence that suggests signs of a potential security incident. IoCs chart specific pieces of evidence that are associated with an attack, like a file name associated with a type of malware. You can think of an IoC as evidence that points to something that's already happened, like noticing that a valuable has been stolen from inside of a car.Â 

Essentially, IoCs help to identify the _who_ and _what_ of an attack after it's taken place, while IoAs focus on finding the _why_ and _how_ of an ongoing or unknown attack. For example, observing a process that makes a network connection is an example of an IoA. The filename of the process and the IP address that the process contacted are examples of the related IoCs.
