**[[Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR)]]** is a collection of applications, tools, and workflows that uses automation to respond to security events. Essentially, this means that handling common security-related incidents with the use of SIEM tools is expected to become a more streamlined process requiring less manual intervention. This frees up security analysts to handle more complex and uncommon incidents that, consequently, canâ€™t be automated with a SOAR. Nevertheless, the expectation is for cybersecurity-related platforms to communicate and interact with one another. Although the technology allowing interconnected systems and devices to communicate with each other exists, it is still a work in progress.

**SOAR Introduction:** Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) is introduced as a collection of applications, tools, and workflows that use automation to respond to security events and incidents. SOAR can also be used for tracking and managing cases, where multiple incidents form a case, and SOAR centralizes the management of these incidents.
