### **Risk analysis dashboard**

The **[[Risk analysis dashboard]]** dashboard ***helps analysts identify risk for each risk object*** (e.g., a specific user, a computer, or an IP address). It shows changes in risk-related activity or behavior, such as a user logging in outside of normal working hours or unusually high network traffic from a specific computer. 

A security analyst might use this dashboard to analyze the potential impact of vulnerabilities in critical assets, which helps analysts prioritize their risk mitigation efforts.
