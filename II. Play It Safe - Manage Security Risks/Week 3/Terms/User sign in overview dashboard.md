### **User sign in overview** **dashboard**

The **[[User sign in overview dashboard]]** provides information about ***user access behavior*** across the organization. 

Security analysts can use this dashboard to access a list of all user sign-in events to identify unusual user activity, such as a user signing in from multiple locations at the same time. This information is then used to help mitigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities to user accounts and the organizationâ€™s applications.
