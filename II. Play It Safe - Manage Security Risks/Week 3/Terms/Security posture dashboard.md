### **Security posture dashboard**

The **[[Security posture dashboard]]** is designed for security operations centers (SOCs). It displays the last 24 hours of an organizationâ€™s notable security-related events and trends and allows security professionals to determine if security infrastructure and policies are performing as designed. 

Security analysts can use this dashboard to monitor and investigate potential threats in real time, such as suspicious network activity originating from a specific IP address.
