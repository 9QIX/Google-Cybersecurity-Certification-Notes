- **[[Log]]** is a record of events that occur within an organization's systems and networks. 
	- Security analysts access a variety of logs from different sources. 
	- Three common log sources include firewall logs, network logs, and server logs. 

- **Definition of Logs:** **[[Log]]** are records of events that occur within an organization's systems. They serve as a detailed account of various events or occurrences. Nearly every device or system can generate logs, making them valuable for security analysts.
	- **Log Contents:** Logs record information about events, including the ***date and time, location, actions taken, and the names of users or systems involved***. This data is essential for both troubleshooting system issues and, most importantly, for security monitoring. Logs enable security analysts to create a narrative and timeline of events, helping them understand what transpired.
	- **Log Analysis:** **[[Log analysis]]** is the process of examining logs to identify events of interest. Given the vast amount of log data generated from different sources, it's important to be selective about what to log. This selective logging approach helps reduce the time spent sifting through log data.

## Logs

Data sources such as devices generate data in the form of events. A **[[log]]** is a record of events that occur within an organization's systems. Logs contain log entries and each entry details information corresponding to a single event that happened on a device or system. Originally, logs served the sole purpose of troubleshooting common technology issues. For example, error logs provide information about why an unexpected error occurred and help to identify the root cause of the error so that it can be fixed. Today, virtually all computing devices produce some form of logs that provide valuable insights beyond troubleshooting. 

Security teams access logs from logging receivers like SIEM tools which consolidate logs to provide a central repository for log data. Security professionals use logs to perform **[[log analysis]]**, which is the process of examining logs to identify events of interest. Logs help uncover the details surrounding the 5 W's of incident investigation: _who_ triggered the incident, _what_ happened, _when_ the incident took place, _where_ the incident took place, and _why_ the incident occurred.
