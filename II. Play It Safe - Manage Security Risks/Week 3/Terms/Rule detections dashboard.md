### **Rule detections** **dashboard**

The **[[Rule detections dashboard]]** ***provides statistics related to incidents with the highest occurrences, severities, and detections*** over time. 

Security analysts can use this dashboard to access a list of all the alerts triggered by a specific detection rule, such as a rule designed to alert whenever a user opens a known malicious attachment from an email. Analysts then use those statistics to help manage recurring incidents and establish mitigation tactics to reduce an organization's level of risk.
