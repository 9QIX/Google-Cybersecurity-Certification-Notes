### **Enterprise insights dashboard**

The **[[Enterprise insights dashboard]]** ***highlights recent alerts***. It identifies suspicious domain names in logs, known as [[Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)]]. Each result is labeled with a confidence score to indicate the likelihood of a threat. It also provides a severity level that indicates the significance of each threat to the organization. 

A security analyst might use this dashboard to monitor login or data access attempts related to a critical asset—like an application or system—from unusual locations or devices.
