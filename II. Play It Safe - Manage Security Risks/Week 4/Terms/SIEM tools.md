**[[SIEM tools]]** - they collect and analyze data. They use this data to detect threats and generate alerts, which can inform the security team of a potential incident. Then, when a security analyst receives a SIEM alert, they can use the appropriate playbook to guide the response process. SIEM tools and playbooks work together to provide a structured and efficient way of responding to potential security incidents.
