A **[[playbook]]** is a manual that provides details about any operational action. 
	- Playbooks also clarify what tools should be used in response to a security incident. In the security field, playbooks are essential. 
	- Urgency, efficiency, and accuracy are necessary to quickly identify and mitigate a security threat to reduce potential risk. 
	- Playbooks ensure that people follow a consistent list of actions in a prescribed way, regardless of who is working on the case. 

## Different types of playbooks:

- Incident response
- Security alerts
- Teams-specific
- Product-specific purposes

### Incident response 

- **[[Incident response]]** is an organization's quick attempt to identify an attack, contain the damage, and correct the effects of a security breach. 
	- An incident response playbook is a guide with six phases used to help mitigate and manage security incidents from beginning to end. Let's discuss each phase. 

## Incident response playbook phases:

- ### **[[Preparation]]**
	- Organizations must prepare to mitigate the likelihood, risk, and impact of a security incident by ***documenting procedures, establishing staffing plans, and educating users***. Preparation sets the foundation for successful incident response. 
	- For example, organizations can create incident response plans and procedures that outline the roles and responsibilities of each security team member. 
- ### **[[Detection and analysis]]**
	- The objective of this phase is to ***detect and analyze events using defined processes and technology***. Using appropriate tools and strategies during this phase helps security analysts determine whether a breach has occurred and analyze its possible magnitude. 
- ### **[[Containment]]**
	- The goal of containment is to ***prevent further damage and reduce the immediate impact of a security incident***. 
	- During this phase, security professionals take actions to contain an incident and minimize damage. Containment is a high priority for organizations because it helps prevent ongoing risks to critical assets and data. 
- ### **[[Eradication and recovery]]**
	- This phase involves the ***complete removal of an incident's artifacts*** so that an organization can return to normal operations. 
	- During this phase, security professionals eliminate artifacts of the incident by removing malicious code and mitigating vulnerabilities. Once they've exercised due diligence, they can begin to restore the affected environment to a secure state. 
	- ***This is also known as IT restoration.***
- ### **[[Post-incident activity]]**
	- This phase ***includes documenting the incident, informing organizational leadership, and applying lessons learned*** to ensure that an organization is better prepared to handle future incidents. 
	- Depending on the severity of the incident, organizations can conduct a full-scale incident analysis to determine the root cause of the incident and implement various updates or improvements to enhance its overall security posture. 
- ### **[[Coordination]]**
	- Coordination involves ***reporting incidents and sharing information, throughout the incident response process***, based on the organization's established standards. 
	- Coordination is important for many reasons. It ensures that organizations meet compliance requirements and it allows for coordinated response and resolution. 

**[[SIEM tools]]** collect and analyze data. They use this data to detect threats and generate alerts, which can inform the security team of a potential incident. 
	- Then, when a security analyst receives a SIEM alert, they can use the appropriate playbook to guide the response process. 
	- SIEM tools and playbooks work together to provide a structured and efficient way of responding to potential security incidents.

# More about playbooks

Previously, you learned that playbooks are tools used by cybersecurity professionals to identify and respond to security issues. In this reading, you’ll learn more about playbooks and their purpose in the field of cybersecurity. 

## Playbook overview

A **[[playbook]]** is a manual that provides details about any operational action. Essentially, a playbook provides a predefined and up-to-date list of steps to perform when responding to an incident.

[[Playbook]]s are accompanied by a strategy. The strategy outlines expectations of team members who are assigned a task, and some playbooks also list the individuals responsible. The outlined expectations are accompanied by a plan. The plan dictates how the specific task outlined in the playbook must be completed.

[[Playbook]]s should be treated as living documents, which means that they are frequently updated by security team members to address industry changes and new threats. Playbooks are generally managed as a collaborative effort, since security team members have different levels of expertise.

Updates are often made if:

- A failure is identified, such as an oversight in the outlined policies and procedures, or in the playbook itself. 
- There is a change in industry standards, such as changes in laws or regulatory compliance.
- The cybersecurity landscape changes due to evolving threat actor tactics and techniques.

## Types of playbooks

Playbooks sometimes cover specific incidents and vulnerabilities. These might include ransomware, vishing, business email compromise (BEC), and other attacks previously discussed. Incident and vulnerability response playbooks are very common, but they are not the only types of playbooks organizations develop. 

Each organization has a different set of playbook tools, methodologies, protocols, and procedures that they adhere to, and different individuals are involved at each step of the response process, depending on the country they are in. For example, incident notification requirements from government-imposed laws and regulations, along with compliance standards, affect the content in the playbooks. These requirements are subject to change based on where the incident originated and the type of data affected. 

### **Incident and vulnerability response playbooks**

[[Incident and vulnerability response playbooks]] are commonly used by entry-level cybersecurity professionals. They are developed based on the goals outlined in an organization’s business continuity plan. A **[[business continuity plan]]** is an established path forward allowing a business to recover and continue to operate as normal, despite a disruption like a security breach.

These two types of playbooks are similar in that they both contain predefined and up-to-date lists of steps to perform when responding to an incident. Following these steps is necessary to ensure that you, as a security professional, are adhering to legal and organizational standards and protocols. These playbooks also help minimize errors and ensure that important actions are performed within a specific timeframe.

When an incident, threat, or vulnerability occurs or is identified, the level of risk to the organization depends on the potential damage to its assets. A basic formula for determining the level of risk is that ***risk equals the likelihood of a threat***. For this reason, a sense of urgency is essential. Following the steps outlined in playbooks is also important if any forensic task is being carried out. Mishandling data can easily compromise forensic data, rendering it unusable. 

Common steps included in incident and vulnerability playbooks include: 

- Preparation
- Detection
- Analysis
- Containment
- Eradication
- Recovery from an incident 

Additional steps include performing post-incident activities, and a coordination of efforts throughout the investigation and incident and vulnerability response stages.

## Key takeaways

It is essential to refine processes and procedures outlined in a playbook. With every documented incident, cybersecurity teams need to consider what was learned from the incident and what improvements should be made to handle incidents more effectively in the future. Playbooks create structure and ensure compliance with the law.
