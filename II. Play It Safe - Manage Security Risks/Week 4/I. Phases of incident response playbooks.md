A **[[playbook]]** is a manual that provides details about any operational action. 
	- Playbooks also clarify what tools should be used in response to a security incident. In the security field, playbooks are essential. 
	- Urgency, efficiency, and accuracy are necessary to quickly identify and mitigate a security threat to reduce potential risk. 
	- Playbooks ensure that people follow a consistent list of actions in a prescribed way, regardless of who is working on the case. 

## Different types of playbooks:

- Incident response
- Security alerts
- Teams-specific
- Product-specific purposes

### Incident response 

- **[[Incident response]]** is an organization's quick attempt to identify an attack, contain the damage, and correct the effects of a security breach. 
	- An incident response playbook is a guide with six phases used to help mitigate and manage security incidents from beginning to end. Let's discuss each phase. 

## Incident response playbook phases:

- ### **[[Preparation]]**
	- Organizations must prepare to mitigate the likelihood, risk, and impact of a security incident by ***documenting procedures, establishing staffing plans, and educating users***. Preparation sets the foundation for successful incident response. 
	- For example, organizations can create incident response plans and procedures that outline the roles and responsibilities of each security team member. 
- ### **[[Detection and analysis]]**
	- The objective of this phase is to ***detect and analyze events using defined processes and technology***. Using appropriate tools and strategies during this phase helps security analysts determine whether a breach has occurred and analyze its possible magnitude. 
- ### **[[Containment]]**
	- The goal of containment is to ***prevent further damage and reduce the immediate impact of a security incident***. 
	- During this phase, security professionals take actions to contain an incident and minimize damage. Containment is a high priority for organizations because it helps prevent ongoing risks to critical assets and data. 
- ### **[[Eradication and recovery]]**
	- This phase involves the c***omplete removal of an incident's artifacts*** so that an organization can return to normal operations. 
	- During this phase, security professionals eliminate artifacts of the incident by removing malicious code and mitigating vulnerabilities. Once they've exercised due diligence, they can begin to restore the affected environment to a secure state. 
	- ***This is also known as IT restoration.***
- ### **[[Post-incident activity]]**
	- This phase ***includes documenting the incident, informing organizational leadership, and applying lessons learned*** to ensure that an organization is better prepared to handle future incidents. 
	- Depending on the severity of the incident, organizations can conduct a full-scale incident analysis to determine the root cause of the incident and implement various updates or improvements to enhance its overall security posture. 
- ### **[[Coordination]]**
	- Coordination involves ***reporting incidents and sharing information, throughout the incident response process***, based on the organization's established standards. 
	- Coordination is important for many reasons. It ensures that organizations meet compliance requirements and it allows for coordinated response and resolution. 

**[[SIEM tools]]** collect and analyze data. They use this data to detect threats and generate alerts, which can inform the security team of a potential incident. 
	- Then, when a security analyst receives a SIEM alert, they can use the appropriate playbook to guide the response process. 
	- SIEM tools and playbooks work together to provide a structured and efficient way of responding to potential security incidents.
