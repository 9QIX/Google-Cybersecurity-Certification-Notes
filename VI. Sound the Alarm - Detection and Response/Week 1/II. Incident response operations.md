# Incident response teams

- **Team Collaboration:** Successful incident response requires teamwork, just like in sports, workplaces, or school settings. Incident response teams rely on the diverse strengths and expertise of their members to work towards a common goal.
- **[[Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT)]]:** CSIRTs are specialized groups of security professionals trained in incident management and response. Their primary objectives include effectively and efficiently managing incidents, providing resources for response and recovery, and preventing future incidents.
- **Shared Responsibility:** Security is a shared responsibility, so CSIRTs collaborate cross-functionally with other departments. For instance, legal teams may need to be consulted if an incident involves a data breach. Compliance requirements might necessitate collaboration with public relations teams for public disclosure.
- **CSIRT Functions:**
	1. **Security Analyst:** Investigates security alerts to determine if an incident has occurred. Assesses the criticality of the incident and remediates some incidents directly.
	2. **Technical Lead:** Takes over highly critical incidents, providing technical leadership throughout the incident's lifecycle.
	3. **Incident Coordinator:** Tracks and manages the activities of the CSIRT and other teams involved in the response effort. Ensures that incident response processes are followed, and teams are updated on the incident's status.
- **Variability in CSIRT Titles and Focus:** Not all CSIRTs have the same title or focus. Depending on the organization, they may be referred to as Incident Handling Teams (IHT) or Security Incident Response Teams (SIRT). Some teams might have a broader or specialized focus. For example, crisis management teams might have a specific role within incident response.
- **Common Goal:** Regardless of their title or focus, all incident response teams share the same objective of managing and responding to security incidents.

The video emphasizes the collaborative nature of incident response teams and their role in effectively managing and responding to security incidents. It also highlights the flexibility in team titles and focuses, while underscoring their shared goal of incident management.
