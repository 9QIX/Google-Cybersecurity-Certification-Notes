# Introduction to the incident response lifecycle

- **Incident Response Frameworks:** Incident response frameworks provide a structured approach for organizations to handle security incidents effectively. They help in standardizing the incident response process, ensuring consistency and efficiency.
- **NIST CSF Core Functions:** The NIST CSF consists of five core functions: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. The video concentrates on the last three functions: detect, respond, and recover. These functions are crucial during the incident response process.
- **[[NIST Incident Response Lifecycle]]:** The NIST incident response lifecycle consists of several phases, which include 
	- Preparation
	- Detection and analysis
	- Containment, eradication and recovery
	- Post-incident activity
- Importantly, this lifecycle is cyclical, allowing for overlapping steps as new information emerges.
- **Understanding Incidents:** The video provides a definition of an incident according to NIST. An **[[incident]]** is an occurrence that threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or an information system without lawful authority. It can also involve violations or imminent threats to security policies, procedures, or acceptable use policies.
	- **Events vs. Security Incidents:** **[[Events]]** are observable occurrences, whereas security incidents involve unlawful actions, policy violations, or actions that threaten information systems' security. The video illustrates the difference with an example involving password resets.
- **[[Incident Investigation]]:** Just as detectives carefully handle and document evidence in a case, security analysts must do the same when investigating security incidents. 
	- An incident investigation aims to determine: 
		- Who triggered the incident
		- What happened
		- When the incident took place 
		- Where the incident took place
		- Why the incident occurred
- **[[Incident Handler's Journal]]:** To facilitate organized documentation of incident details, the video recommends using an incident handler's journal. This journal helps security analysts record vital information during incident response and investigation.

The video provides an in-depth understanding of incident response frameworks, with a focus on the NIST CSF and the cyclical nature of the NIST incident response lifecycle. It also underscores the significance of clear incident definitions and thorough documentation in the incident response process.
