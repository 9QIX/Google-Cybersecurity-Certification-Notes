# Incident response tools

- **Analogy to a Carpenter's Toolbox:** Just as a carpenter relies on a variety of tools like a tape measure, saw, and sandpaper to create furniture, a security analyst uses various tools and technologies to monitor, detect, and analyze security events.
- **Tools in a Security Analyst's Toolbox:** As a security analyst, you won't depend on a single tool for your tasks. Instead, you'll use a combination of tools, including:
	- **[[Detection and Management Tools]]:** These tools help monitor system activity and identify events that require investigation.
	- **[[Documentation Tools]]:** Tools for collecting and compiling evidence during an investigation.
	- **[[Investigative Tools]]:** Tools like packet sniffers for analyzing security events.
- **Continuous Learning:** The security field is dynamic, with evolving threats and emerging security technologies. Security analysts need to continually expand their knowledge and toolsets to stay effective at detecting threats.
- **Incident Handler's Journal:** The video introduces the incident handler's journal, which will be used throughout the course as a form of documentation. This journal serves as one of the first tools in a security analyst's toolbox.

The video underscores the need for security analysts to adapt and keep their skills and toolsets up to date to effectively detect and respond to evolving security threats.

# The value of documentation

- **Documentation Defined:** **[[Documentation]]** is any recorded content, which can take various forms like audio, digital text, handwritten notes, or videos. The purpose of documentation is to provide instructions and guidance on specific topics.
	- **Types of Documentation:** There are multiple types of documentation used in incident response, including:
		- Playbooks
		- Incident handler's journals 
		- Policies
		- Plans
		- Final reports
	- The video highlights that there's no industry-standard for documentation, and organizations often customize their documentation practices based on their specific needs and legal requirements.
- **Importance of Effective Documentation:** Effective documentation plays a crucial role in reducing uncertainty and confusion, particularly during security incidents when urgency is paramount. Clear, consistent, and accurate documentation enables security professionals to respond swiftly and decisively.
- **Documentation Tools:** Various tools and software can be employed for documentation, such as word processors (e.g., Google Docs, OneNote, Evernote, Notepad++), ticketing systems (e.g., Jira), Google Sheets, audio recorders, cameras, and handwritten notes.
- **Ongoing Discussion:** The video concludes by mentioning that the discussion on documentation has just begun, and learners will soon apply their documentation skills using their incident handler's journal.

The video underscores the critical role of documentation in incident response, ensuring that security professionals can effectively manage and respond to security incidents with clarity and accuracy.

# Intrusion detection systems

- **Home Intrusion Security System Analogy:** The video starts with an analogy of a home intrusion security system, where sensors detect intrusions by sending out sound waves and triggering alerts when something disrupts these waves.
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** An IDS is introduced as a system that functions similarly to home intrusion sensors. It monitors system and network activity, collecting and analyzing data for signs of abnormal activities. If unusual activities are detected, the IDS generates alerts to notify relevant personnel and channels.
- **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS):** The video uses an analogy of a jewelry storefront with a window sensor to explain IPS. An IPS, like an IDS, monitors system activity for intrusions but has additional capabilities to take action and prevent intrusions from happening.
- **Tools with IDS and IPS Functions:** Several tools are mentioned that can perform the functions of both IDS and IPS. Some popular tools highlighted include Snort, Zeek, Kismet, Sagan, and Suricata, with a promise to explore Suricata in upcoming lessons.
- **Alert Notifications Management:** The video hints at managing alert notifications using security information and event management (SIEM) tools, suggesting that this topic will be covered in future lessons.

The video provides a clear and relatable explanation of IDS and IPS by using everyday analogies, making it easier for learners to understand the basic concepts of intrusion detection and prevention systems.
