# Incident response tools

- **Analogy to a Carpenter's Toolbox:** Just as a carpenter relies on a variety of tools like a tape measure, saw, and sandpaper to create furniture, a security analyst uses various tools and technologies to monitor, detect, and analyze security events.
- **Tools in a Security Analyst's Toolbox:** As a security analyst, you won't depend on a single tool for your tasks. Instead, you'll use a combination of tools, including:
	- **Detection and Management Tools:** These tools help monitor system activity and identify events that require investigation.
	- **Documentation Tools:** Tools for collecting and compiling evidence during an investigation.
	- **Investigative Tools:** Tools like packet sniffers for analyzing security events.
- **Continuous Learning:** The security field is dynamic, with evolving threats and emerging security technologies. Security analysts need to continually expand their knowledge and toolsets to stay effective at detecting threats.
- **Incident Handler's Journal:** The video introduces the incident handler's journal, which will be used throughout the course as a form of documentation. This journal serves as one of the first tools in a security analyst's toolbox.

The video underscores the need for security analysts to adapt and keep their skills and toolsets up to date to effectively detect and respond to evolving security threats.
