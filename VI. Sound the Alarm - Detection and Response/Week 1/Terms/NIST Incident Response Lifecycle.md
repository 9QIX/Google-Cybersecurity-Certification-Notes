- **[[NIST Incident Response Lifecycle]]:** The NIST incident response lifecycle consists of several phases, which include 
	- Preparation
	- Detection and analysis
	- Containment, eradication and recovery
	- Post-incident activity
- Importantly, this lifecycle is ***cyclical***, allowing for overlapping steps as new information emerges.

# Apply the NIST lifecycle to a vishing scenario

## Vishing attack: how to respond?

- ### [[Preparation]]: the planning and training process
	- The organization takes action to ensure it has the correct tools and resources in place:
		- Set up uniform company email conventions
		- Create a collaborative, ethical environment where employees feel comfortable asking questions
		- Provide cybersecurity training on a quarterly basis
- ### [[Detection and analysis]]: the detect and assess process
	- Security professionals create processes to detect and assess incidents:
		- Identify signs of an incident
		- Filter external emails to flag messages containing attachments such as voicemails
		- Have an incident response plan to reference
- ### [[Containment, eradication, and recovery]]: the minimize and mitigate process
	- Security professionals and stakeholders collaborate to minimize the impact of the incident and mitigate any operational disruption.
		- Communicate with sender to confirm the origin of the voice message
		- Provide employees with an easy way to report and contain suspicious messages
- ### [[Post-incident activity]]: the learning process
	- New protocols, procedures, playbooks, etc. are implemented to help reduce any similar incidents in the future.
		- Update the playbook to highlight additional red flags employees should be aware of
		- Review processes and workflows related to permissions and adjust oversight of those permissions
