- **[[Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT)]]:** CSIRTs are specialized groups of security professionals trained in incident management and response. Their primary objectives include effectively and efficiently managing incidents, providing resources for response and recovery, and preventing future incidents.
	- **Shared Responsibility:** Security is a shared responsibility, so CSIRTs collaborate cross-functionally with other departments. For instance, legal teams may need to be consulted if an incident involves a data breach. Compliance requirements might necessitate collaboration with public relations teams for public disclosure.
- **CSIRT Functions:**
	1. **[[Security Analyst]]:** Investigates security alerts to determine if an incident has occurred. Assesses the criticality of the incident and remediates some incidents directly.
	2. **[[Technical Lead]]:** Takes over highly critical incidents, providing technical leadership throughout the incident's lifecycle.
	3. **[[Incident Coordinator]]:** Tracks and manages the activities of the CSIRT and other teams involved in the response effort. Ensures that incident response processes are followed, and teams are updated on the incident's status.
