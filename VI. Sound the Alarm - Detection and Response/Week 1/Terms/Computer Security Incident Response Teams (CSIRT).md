- **[[Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT)]]:** CSIRTs are specialized groups of security professionals trained in incident management and response. Their primary objectives include effectively and efficiently managing incidents, providing resources for response and recovery, and preventing future incidents.
	- **Shared Responsibility:** Security is a shared responsibility, so CSIRTs collaborate cross-functionally with other departments. For instance, legal teams may need to be consulted if an incident involves a data breach. Compliance requirements might necessitate collaboration with public relations teams for public disclosure.
