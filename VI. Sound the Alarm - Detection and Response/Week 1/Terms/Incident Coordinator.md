**[[Incident Coordinator]]:** Tracks and manages the activities of the CSIRT and other teams involved in the response effort. Ensures that incident response processes are followed, and teams are updated on the incident's status.

### **Incident coordinator**

Responding to an incident also requires cross-collaboration with non-security professionals. CSIRTs will often consult with and leverage the expertise of members from external departments. The job of the **[[incident coordinator]]** is to coordinate with the relevant departments during a security incident. By doing so, the lines of communication are open and clear, and all personnel are made aware of the incident status. Incident coordinators can also be found in other teams, like the SOC.Â
