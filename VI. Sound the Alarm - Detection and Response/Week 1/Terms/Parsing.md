_[[Parsing]]_ maps data according to their fields and their corresponding values. For example, the following log example contains fields with values. At first, it might be difficult to interpret information from this log based on its format:

- **Parsing with the Split Method:** **[[Parsing]]** is described as the process of converting data into a more readable format. 
	- The method introduced for parsing in this context is the `split` method. It is explained that the `split` method converts a string into a list by separating the string based on a specified character. If no argument is passed, it separates the string based on whitespace. An example is provided, demonstrating how the split method can be used to convert a string into a list, making it easier to analyze.

## Parsing

Part of working with files involves structuring its contents to meet your needs. **[[Parsing]]** is the process of converting data into a more readable format. Data may need to become more readable in a couple of different ways. First, certain parts of your Python code may require modification into a specific format. By converting data into this format, you enable Python to process it in a specific way. Second, programmers need to read and interpret the results of their code, and parsing can also make the data more readable for them.

Methods that can help you parse your data include .split() and .join().
