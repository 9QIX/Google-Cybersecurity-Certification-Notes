## Overview of EDR tools  

**[[Endpoint detection and response (EDR)]]** is an application that monitors an endpoint for malicious activity. EDR tools are installed on endpoints. Remember that an **endpoint** is any device connected on a network. Examples include end-user devices, like computers, phones, tablets, and more.

EDR tools monitor, record, and analyze endpoint system activity to identify, alert, and respond to suspicious activity. Unlike IDS or IPS tools, EDRs collect endpoint activity data and perform _behavioral analysis_ to identify threat patterns happening on an endpoint. Behavioral analysis uses the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence to analyze system behavior to identify malicious or unusual activity. EDR tools also use _automation_ to stop attacks without the manual intervention of security professionals. For example, if an EDR detects an unusual process starting up on a user’s workstation that normally is not used, it can automatically block the process from running.

Tools like Open EDR®, Bitdefender™ Endpoint Detection and Response, and FortiEDR™ are examples of EDR tools.

**Note**: Security information and event management (SIEM) tools also have detection capabilities, which you'll explore later.
