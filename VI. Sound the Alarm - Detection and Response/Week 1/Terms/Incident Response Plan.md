- **[[Incident Response Plan]]**: A document that outlines the procedures to take in each step of incident response.
	- **Components of Incident Response Plans:** Incident response plans consist of three basic elements: policies, standards, and procedures. These plans provide step-by-step instructions on how to respond to incidents and help ensure a well-organized response.
	- **Customization of Plans:** Organizations tailor their incident response plans to meet their unique requirements, considering factors such as their mission, size, culture, industry, and structure. Some may include the incident response plan within their security plan, while others keep them as separate documents.
- **Common Elements in Incident Plans:** While plans can vary, they typically include common elements, such as:
	1. **[[Incident Response Procedures]]:** Detailed instructions on how to respond to incidents.
	2. **[[System Information]]:** Information about the organization's systems, including network diagrams, data flow diagrams, logging, and asset inventory details.
	3. **[[Other Documents]]:** Contact lists, forms, and templates that facilitate incident response.
