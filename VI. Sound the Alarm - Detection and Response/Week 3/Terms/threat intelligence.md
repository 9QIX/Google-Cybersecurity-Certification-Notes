Organizations can improve their detection capabilities by staying updated on the evolving threat landscape and understanding the relationship between their environment and malicious actors. One way to understand threats is by using **[[threat intelligence]]**, which is evidence-based threat information that provides context about existing or emerging threats. 

Threat intelligence can come from private or public sources like:

- **[[Industry reports]]**: These often include details about attacker's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP).
- **[[Government advisories]]:** Similar to industry reports, government advisories include details about attackers' TTP. 
- **[[Threat data feeds]]**: Threat data feeds provide a stream of threat-related data that can be used to help protect against sophisticated attackers like **[[advanced persistent threats (APTs)]]**. APTs are instances when a threat actor maintains unauthorized access to a system for an extended period of time. The data is usually a list of indicators like IP addresses, domains, and file hashes.

It can be difficult for organizations to efficiently manage large volumes of threat intelligence. Organizations can leverage a **[[threat intelligence platform (TIP)]]** which is an application that collects, centralizes, and analyzes threat intelligence from different sources. TIPs provide a centralized platform for organizations to identify and prioritize relevant threats and improve their security posture.

**Note**: Threat intelligence data feeds are best used to add context to detections. They should not drive detections completely and should be assessed before applied to an organization.

Security analysts need a way to expand the use of IoCs so that they can add context to alerts. **[[Threat intelligence]]** is evidence-based threat information that provides context about existing or emerging threats. By accessing additional information related to IoCs, security analysts can expand their viewpoint to observe the bigger picture and construct a narrative that helps inform their response actions.
