**[[Receive and assess]]** the alert to determine if it's a false positive or if it's related to an existing incident.
### **Receive and assess**

During this first step of the triage process, a security analyst receives an alert from an alerting system like an **intrusion detection system** (IDS). You might recall that an IDS is an application that monitors system activity and alerts on possible intrusions. The analyst then reviews the alert to verify its validity and ensure they have a complete understanding of the alert. 

This involves gathering as much information as possible about the alert, including details about the activity that triggered the alert, the systems and assets involved, and more. Here are some questions to consider when verifying the validity of an alert: 

- **Is the alert a false positive?** Security analysts must determine whether the alert is a genuine security concern or a **false positive**, or an alert that incorrectly detects the presence of a threat.
- **Was this alert triggered in the past?** If so, how was it resolved? The history of an alert can help determine whether the alert is a new or recurring issue. 
- **Is the alert triggered by a known vulnerability?** If an alert is triggered by a known vulnerability, security analysts can leverage existing knowledge to determine an appropriate response and minimize the impact of the vulnerability. 
- **What is the severity of the alert?** The severity of an alert can help determine the priority of the response so that critical issues are quickly escalated.
