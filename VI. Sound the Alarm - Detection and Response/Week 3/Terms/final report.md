- **Documentation and Final Report:** Various types of documentation are updated or created during this phase. One of the most important documents is the final report. The **[[final report]]** provides a comprehensive review of the incident, including a timeline of events and details related to the incident. It also includes recommendations for future prevention and mitigation.
	- **[[Lessons Learned Meeting]]:** To improve processes and responses, organizations often hold a lessons learned meeting. This meeting typically involves all parties involved in the incident and is typically held within two weeks after the incident. 
		- The **[[final report]]** serves as a reference document during this meeting. The goal of the meeting is to discuss what happened, what actions were taken, and how effective those actions were. It's an opportunity to share ideas and information about the incident and how to enhance future response efforts.
	- **Questions to Ask:** During a lessons learned meeting, participants can ask various questions to gain a better understanding of the incident. These questions may include: 
		- What happened? 
		- What time did it happen? 
		- Who discovered it? 
		- How did it get contained? 
		- What were the actions taken for recovery? 
		- What could have been done differently?

## Final report

Throughout this course, you explored the importance that documentation has in recording details during the incident response lifecycle. At a minimum, incident response documentation should describe the incident by covering the 5 W's of incident investigation: _who_, _what_, _where_, _why_, and _when._ The details that are captured during incident response are important for developing additional documents during the end of the lifecycle.

One of the most essential forms of documentation that gets created during the end of an incident is the **[[final report]]**. The final report provides a comprehensive review of an incident. Final reports are not standardized, and their formats can vary across organizations. Additionally, multiple final reports can be created depending on the audience it’s written for. Here are some examples of common elements found in a final report:

- **[[Executive summary]]**: A high-level summary of the report including the key findings and essential facts related to the incident
- **[[Timeline]]**:  A detailed chronological timeline of the incident that includes timestamps dating the sequence of events that led to the incident
- **[[Investigation]]**: A compilation of the actions taken during the detection and analysis of the incident. For example, analysis of a network artifact such as a packet capture reveals information about what activities happen on a network.
- **[[Recommendations]]**: A list of suggested actions for future prevention

**Pro tip**: When writing the final report, consider the audience that you’re writing the report for. Oftentimes, business executives and other non-security professionals who don’t have the expertise to understand technical details will read post-incident final reports. Considering the audience when writing a final report will help you effectively communicate the most important details.
