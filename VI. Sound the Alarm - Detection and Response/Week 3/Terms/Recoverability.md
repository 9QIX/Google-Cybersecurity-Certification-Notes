**[[Recoverability]]:** How an organization recovers from an incident depends on the size and scope of the incident and the amount of resources available. In some cases, recovery might not be possible, like when a malicious actor successfully steals proprietary data and shares it publicly. Spending time, effort, and resources on an incident with no recoverability can be wasteful. It’s important to consider whether recovery is possible and consider whether it’s worth the time and cost.
