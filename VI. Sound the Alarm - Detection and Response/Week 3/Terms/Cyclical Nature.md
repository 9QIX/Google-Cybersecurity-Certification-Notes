**[[Cyclical Nature]]:** It's important to remember that the incident response lifecycle is cyclical. Multiple incidents can occur over time, and some incidents may be related. Security teams may need to revisit previous phases of the lifecycle to conduct additional investigations or take further actions. The goal is to continually improve incident response and learn from each incident to enhance the organization's security posture.
