**[[Detection]]:** Detection involves the rapid discovery of security events. Security tools, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, collect and analyze event data from various sources to identify potentially unusual activity. If an incident is detected, such as a successful unauthorized access, an alert is generated.
