**[[Indicators of attack (IoA)]]** are the series of observed events that indicate a real-time incident.Â  IoAs focus on identifying the behavioral evidence of an attacker, including their methods and intentions.

Essentially, IoCs help to identify the _who_ and _what_ of an attack after it's taken place, while IoAs focus on finding the _why_ and _how_ of an ongoing or unknown attack. For example, observing a process that makes a network connection is an example of an IoA. The filename of the process and the IP address that the process contacted are examples of the related IoCs.
