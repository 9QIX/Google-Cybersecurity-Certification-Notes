## The power of crowdsourcing

**[[Crowdsourcing]]** is the practice of gathering information using public input and collaboration. Threat intelligence platforms use crowdsourcing to collect information from the global cybersecurity community. Traditionally, an organization's response to incidents was performed in isolation. A security team would receive and analyze an alert, and then work to remediate it without additional insights on how to approach it. Without crowdsourcing, attackers can perform the same attacks against multiple organizations.

With crowdsourcing, organizations harness the knowledge of millions of other cybersecurity professionals, including cybersecurity product vendors, government agencies, cloud providers, and more. Crowdsourcing allows people and organizations from the global cybersecurity community to openly share and access a collection of threat intelligence data, which helps to continuously improve detection technologies and methodologies.Â 

Examples of information-sharing organizations include **[[Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs)]]**, which focus on collecting and sharing sector-specific threat intelligence to companies within specific industries like energy, healthcare, and others. **[[Open-source intelligence (OSINT)]]** is the collection and analysis of information from publicly available sources to generate usable intelligence. OSINT can also be used as a method to gather information related to threat actors, threats, vulnerabilities, and more.

This threat intelligence data is used to improve the detection methods and techniques of security products, like detection tools or anti-virus software. For example, attackers often perform the same attacks on multiple targets with the hope that one of them will be successful. Once an organization detects an attack, they can immediately publish the attack details, such as malicious files, IP addresses, or URLs, to tools like VirusTotal. This threat intelligence can then help other organizations defend against the same attack.
