**[[Threat data feeds]]**: Threat data feeds provide a stream of threat-related data that can be used to help protect against sophisticated attackers like **advanced persistent threats (APTs)**. APTs are instances when a threat actor maintains unauthorized access to a system for an extended period of time. The data is usually a list of indicators like IP addresses, domains, and file hashes.
