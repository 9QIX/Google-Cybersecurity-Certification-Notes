**Triage in Security:** **[[Triage]]** is also applied in the field of security. Before an alert is escalated, it goes through a triage process to determine its level of importance or urgency. Security teams have limited resources available for incident response, and not all incidents are equal. Incidents are triaged based on the threat they pose to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems.
