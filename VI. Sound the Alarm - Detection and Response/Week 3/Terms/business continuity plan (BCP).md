Similar to an incident response plan, a **[[business continuity plan (BCP)]]** is a document that outlines the procedures to sustain business operations during and after a significant disruption. A BCP helps organizations ensure that critical business functions can resume or can be quickly restored when an incident occurs.

Entry level security analysts aren't typically responsible for the development and testing of a BCP. However, it's important that you understand how BCPs provide organizations with a structured way to respond and recover from security incidents.

**Note**: Business continuity plans are not the same as _disaster recovery plans_. **[[Disaster recovery plans]]** are used to recover information systems in response to a major disaster. These disasters can range from hardware failure to the destruction of facilities from a natural disaster, like a flood.Â
