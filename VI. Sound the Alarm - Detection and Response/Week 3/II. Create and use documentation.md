# The benefits of documentation

- **Scalability:** Documentation is crucial for the scalability of a security operations team. When security engineers develop detection rules, documenting the meaning of rule activations, severity assignments, potential false positives, and steps for confirming the alert's legitimacy is essential. Without documentation, the team cannot efficiently grow beyond one or two analysts.
- **Benefits of Documentation:**
	- **[[Transparency]]:** Documentation provides transparency by creating a record of incidents and events. This transparent documentation serves as valuable evidence for security insurance claims, regulatory investigations, and legal proceedings.
	- **[[Standardization]]:** Documentation supports standardization by establishing guidelines and standards for completing tasks and workflows. Examples of this standardization include creating an organization's security policy, processes, and procedures. Standardization ensures consistent quality of work by providing clear rules to follow.
	- **[[Clarity]]:** Effective documentation offers clarity by providing team members with a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities. It also offers instructions on how to perform tasks, such as incident response playbooks, which prevent uncertainty and confusion.
- **Adaptability:** The security field is dynamic, with evolving threats and changing regulatory requirements. Therefore, maintaining, reviewing, and updating documentation regularly is crucial to keeping it relevant and aligning with any changes in the security landscape.
- **Value of Documentation Time:** While security professionals may have various responsibilities, dedicating time to documentation is valuable. Documenting actions helps in recalling facts and information and can reveal gaps in previous actions. Documentation benefits not only the individual but the entire organization.

In conclusion, documentation is an essential tool for security professionals, aiding in scalability, transparency, standardization, clarity, and adaptability within the dynamic field of security.

# Document evidence with chain of custody forms

**[[Chain of custody]]** is a crucial process in the field of digital forensics and security incident response. It involves documenting the possession and control of evidence throughout the incident's lifecycle. The use of chain of custody forms is essential for ensuring the transparency of evidence handling, particularly when it may be requested for legal proceedings. Here's a summary of key points from the video:

- **Chain of Custody Definition:** Chain of custody is the process of documenting evidence possession and control during an incident lifecycle. It is initiated as soon as evidence is collected, and the forms should be continuously updated as the evidence is handled.
- **Digital Forensics Example:** The video presents a simplified example of chain of custody in the context of digital forensic analysis. In this scenario, a compromised hard drive is collected as potential evidence. Aisha, who initially collects the hard drive, ensures that it is write-protected, calculates and records a cryptographic hash of the drive's image, and then transfers it to the forensics department. The transfer of the hard drive to different analysts requires logging the movements and handling in the chain of custody form.
- **Purpose of Chain of Custody:** The primary purpose of the chain of custody process is to maintain a transparent paper trail that documents who handled the evidence, when and why it was handled, and where it was located. This documentation ensures the integrity, reliability, and accuracy of the evidence.
- **Elements of a Chain of Custody Form:** Although there's no standard template for chain of custody forms, they typically contain common elements, including a description of the evidence (identifying information), a custody log (record of transfers with names, dates, times, and purposes), and other relevant details.

- **[[Broken Chain of Custody]]:** A "broken chain of custody" occurs when there are inconsistencies in the collection and logging of evidence in the chain of custody. In the legal context, a broken chain of custody can impact the trustworthiness of evidence, and it may affect its admissibility in court proceedings.
- **[[Legal Standards]]:** Chain of custody forms are crucial for meeting legal standards and ensuring that evidence can be used in legal proceedings. They help establish proof of the:
	- Integrity
	- Reliability
	- Accuracy 
- Of the evidence, especially in cases where malicious actions are involved.

In conclusion, chain of custody is a vital process in incident response and digital forensics. It helps maintain the transparency and integrity of evidence, making it suitable for use in legal contexts, especially when investigating and prosecuting malicious actors for their actions.

# Best practices for effective documentation

**[[Documentation]]** is any form of recorded content that is used for a specific purpose, and it is essential in the field of security. Security teams use documentation to support investigations, complete tasks, and communicate findings. This reading explores the benefits of documentation and provides you with a list of common practices to help you create effective documentation in your security career.

## Documentation benefits

You’ve already learned about many types of security documentation, including playbooks, final reports, and more. As you’ve also learned, effective documentation has three benefits:

1. Transparency
2. Standardization
3. Clarity

### **Transparency**

In security, **[[transparency]]** is critical for demonstrating compliance with regulations and internal processes, meeting insurance requirements, and for legal proceedings. **[[Chain of custody]]** is the process of documenting evidence possession and control during an incident lifecycle. Chain of custody is an example of how documentation produces transparency and an audit trail.

### **Standardization**

Standardization through repeatable processes and procedures supports continuous improvement efforts, helps with knowledge transfer, and facilitates the onboarding of new team members. **Standards** are references that inform how to set policies.

You have learned how NIST provides various security frameworks that are used to improve security measures. Likewise, organizations set up their own standards to meet their business needs. An example of documentation that establishes standardization is an **incident response plan**, which is a document that outlines the procedures to take in each step of incident response. Incident response plans standardize an organization’s response process by outlining procedures in advance of an incident. By documenting an organization’s incident response plan, you create a standard that people follow, maintaining consistency with repeatable processes and procedures.

### **Clarity**

Ideally, all documentation provides clarity to its audience. Clear documentation helps people quickly access the information they need so they can take necessary action. Security analysts are required to document the reasoning behind any action they take so that it’s clear to their team why an alert was escalated or closed.

## Best practices

As a security professional, you’ll need to apply documentation best practices in your career. Here are some general guidelines to remember:

### **Know your audience**

Before you start creating documentation, consider your audience and their needs. For instance, an incident summary written for a security operations center (SOC) manager will be written differently than one that's drafted for a chief executive officer (CEO). The SOC manager can understand technical security language but a CEO might not. Tailor your document to meet your audience’s needs.

### **Be concise**

You might be tasked with creating long documentation, such as a report. But when documentation is too long, people can be discouraged from using it. To ensure that your documentation is useful, establish the purpose immediately. This helps people quickly identify the objective of the document. For example, executive summaries outline the major facts of an incident at the beginning of a final report. This summary should be brief so that it can be easily skimmed to identify the key findings. 

### **Update regularly** 

In security, new vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited constantly. Documentation must be regularly reviewed and updated to keep up with the evolving threat landscape. For example, after an incident has been resolved, a comprehensive review of the incident can identify gaps in processes and procedures that require changes and updates. By regularly updating documentation, security teams stay well informed and incident response plans stay updated.

## Key takeaways

Effective documentation produces benefits for everyone in an organization. Knowing how to create documentation is an essential skill to have as a security analyst. As you continue in your journey to become a security professional, be sure to consider these practices for creating effective documentation.
