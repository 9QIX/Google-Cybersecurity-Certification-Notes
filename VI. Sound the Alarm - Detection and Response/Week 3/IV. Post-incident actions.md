# The post-incident activity phase of the lifecycle

- **Purpose of Post-Incident Activity:** The post-incident activity phase occurs after an incident has been successfully contained, eradicated, and recovered from. This phase focuses on learning and improvement. It involves reviewing the incident to identify areas for improvement during incident handling.
- **Documentation and Final Report:** Various types of documentation are updated or created during this phase. One of the most important documents is the final report. The final report provides a comprehensive review of the incident, including a timeline of events and details related to the incident. It also includes recommendations for future prevention and mitigation.
- **Lessons Learned Meeting:** To improve processes and responses, organizations often hold a lessons learned meeting. This meeting typically involves all parties involved in the incident and is typically held within two weeks after the incident. The final report serves as a reference document during this meeting. The goal of the meeting is to discuss what happened, what actions were taken, and how effective those actions were. It's an opportunity to share ideas and information about the incident and how to enhance future response efforts.
- **Questions to Ask:** During a lessons learned meeting, participants can ask various questions to gain a better understanding of the incident. These questions may include: What happened? When did it happen? Who discovered it? How was it contained? What actions were taken for recovery? What could have been done differently?
- **Avoiding Blame:** It's important to approach incident reviews without a blame-oriented mindset. Instead of blaming individuals for their actions or mistakes, the focus should be on learning and improving. Incidents often involve human errors, and these errors should be seen as opportunities for learning and strengthening incident response processes.

The post-incident activity phase is essential for continuous improvement in an organization's security incident response capabilities. By reviewing and learning from past incidents, security teams can become more effective at preventing, detecting, and responding to future incidents.
