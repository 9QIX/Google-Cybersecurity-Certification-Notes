# Reexamine SIEM tools

- **SIEM Overview:** **[[Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)]]**. It is an application used to collect, analyze, and report on log data from various sources within an organization. SIEM tools play a critical role in monitoring and managing security-related activities.
- **SIEM Data Collection Process:** SIEM tools go through a systematic data collection process that involves the following steps:
	1. **[[Data Collection and Processing]]:** SIEM tools collect and process vast amounts of data generated by devices and systems throughout an environment. This data comes in different formats.
	2. **[[Normalization]]:** SIEM tools normalize the data, ensuring that it is consistently formatted and includes only relevant event information. Normalization simplifies data analysis.
	3. **[[Indexing]]:** The normalized data is indexed, making it easily accessible through search. This indexing allows security analysts to quickly access and analyze events from various sources.
- **SIEM Flexibility:** As a security analyst, you may encounter different SIEM tools based on your organization's preferences. It's essential to be adaptable and proficient with the specific SIEM tool your organization utilizes.
- **SIEM Platforms:** Two examples of SIEM tools were introduced:
	1. **[[Splunk]]:** Splunk is a data analysis platform that offers SIEM solutions. It collects data from multiple sources, processes and stores it in an index, and provides various methods for accessing and searching the data.
	2. **[[Chronicle]]:** Chronicle is Google Cloud's SIEM, which receives security data, normalizes it for efficient processing, and makes it accessible through a search interface.
These SIEM tools play a pivotal role in the work of a security analyst by simplifying the process of collecting, analyzing, and accessing data from various sources. They empower security analysts to efficiently monitor systems, investigate incidents, and respond to potential security threats. In the next section, you'll delve into the practical aspect of using SIEM tools by learning how to search for and analyze security data on these platforms.

# Log sources and log ingestion

In this reading, you’ll explore more on the importance of log ingestion. You may recall that **security information and event management** (**SIEM**) tools collect and analyze log data to monitor critical activities in an organization. You also learned about **log analysis,** which is the process of examining logs to identify events of interest. Understanding how log sources are ingested into SIEM tools is important because it helps security analysts understand the types of data that are being collected, and can help analysts identify and prioritize security incidents.

## SIEM process overview

Previously, you covered the SIEM process. As a refresher, the process consists of three steps:

1. **Collect and aggregate data**: SIEM tools collect event data from various data sources.
2. **Normalize data**: Event data that's been collected becomes normalized. Normalization converts data into a standard format so that data is structured in a consistent way and becomes easier to read and search. While data normalization is a common feature in many SIEM tools, it's important to note that SIEM tools vary in their data normalization capabilities.
3. **Analyze data**: After the data is collected and normalized, SIEM tools analyze and correlate the data to identify common patterns that indicate unusual activity.

This reading focuses on the first step of this process, the collection and aggregation of data.

## Log ingestion

Data is required for SIEM tools to work effectively. SIEM tools must first collect data using log ingestion. Log ingestion is the process of collecting and importing data from log sources into a SIEM tool. Data comes from any source that generates log data, like a server.

In log ingestion, the SIEM creates a copy of the event data it receives and retains it within its own storage. This copy allows the SIEM to analyze and process the data without directly modifying the original source logs. The collection of event data provides a centralized platform for security analysts to analyze the data and respond to incidents. This event data includes authentication attempts, network activity, and more.

### Log forwarders

There are many ways SIEM tools can ingest log data. For instance, you can manually upload data or use software to help collect data for log ingestion. Manually uploading data may be inefficient and time-consuming because networks can contain thousands of systems and devices. Hence, it's easier to use software that helps collect data. 

A common way that organizations collect log data is to use log forwarders. Log forwarders are software that automate the process of collecting and sending log data. Some operating systems have native log forwarders. If you are using an operating system that does not have a native log forwarder, you would need to install a third-party log forwarding software on a device. After installing it, you'd configure the software to specify which logs to forward and where to send them. For example, you can configure the logs to be sent to a SIEM tool. The SIEM tool would then process and normalize the data. This allows the data to be easily searched, explored, correlated, and analyzed.

**Note**: Many SIEM tools utilize their own proprietary log forwarders. SIEM tools can also integrate with open-source log forwarders. Choosing the right log forwarder depends on many factors such as the specific requirements of your system or organization, compatibility with your existing infrastructure, and more. 

## Key takeaways

SIEM tools require data to be effective. As a security analyst, you will utilize SIEM tools to access events and analyze logs when you're investigating an incident. In your security career, you may even be tasked with configuring a SIEM to collect log data. It's important that you understand how data is ingested into SIEM tools because this enables you to understand where log sources come from which can help you identify the source of a security incident.
