# The importance of logs

- **Definition of Logs:** **[[Log]]** are records of events that occur within an organization's systems. They serve as a detailed account of various events or occurrences. Nearly every device or system can generate logs, making them valuable for security analysts.
	- **Log Contents:** Logs record information about events, including the ***date and time, location, actions taken, and the names of users or systems involved***. This data is essential for both troubleshooting system issues and, most importantly, for security monitoring. Logs enable security analysts to create a narrative and timeline of events, helping them understand what transpired.
	- **Log Analysis:** **[[Log analysis]]** is the process of examining logs to identify events of interest. Given the vast amount of log data generated from different sources, it's important to be selective about what to log. This selective logging approach helps reduce the time spent sifting through log data.
- **[[SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)]]:** SIEM tools play a crucial role in log management. They collect data from multiple sources, aggregate or centralize the data in one location, and normalize diverse log formats into a single preferred format. SIEM tools enable security analysts to process large log volumes in real-time, supporting their investigations.
- **Log Collection:** **[[Log forwarders]]**, which are software applications, collect logs from various sources and automatically forward them to a centralized log repository for storage.
	- **Types of Log Data Sources:** Different devices and systems create logs, resulting in various types of log data sources. These include: 
		- **Network logs** (e.g., from routers, switches, firewalls)
		- **System logs** (from operating systems)
		- **Application logs** (related to software applications)
		- **Security logs** (from security tools like IDS or IPS)
		- **Authentication logs** (recording login attempts)
- **Example of Network Log:** The video provides an example of a network log from a router. The log entry includes information about the action (ALLOW), the source IP address, and the timestamp, which is crucial for establishing a timeline of events.
