**[[Signature Analysis]]:** IDS technologies use different detection methods, with signature analysis being one of the most common. Signature analysis involves using predefined sets of rules known as signatures. The IDS compares network or system activity against these signatures. If a match is found, the IDS generates an alert. For example, a signature can be configured to trigger an alert if it detects three consecutive failed login attempts, indicating a possible password attack.
