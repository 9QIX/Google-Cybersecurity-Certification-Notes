A **[[key-value pair]]** is a set of data that represents two linked items: a key and its corresponding value. A key-value pair consists of a key followed by a colon, and then followed by a value. An example of a key-value pair isÂ  `"Alert": "Malware"`.

**Note**: For readability, it is recommended that key-value pairs contain a space before or after the colon that separates the key and value.
