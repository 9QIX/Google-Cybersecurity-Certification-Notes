**[[Host-Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)]]:** HIDS is a type of IDS that monitors the activity of the host on which it is installed. It is installed as an agent on individual hosts (e.g., laptops, servers) and records output as logs when it detects suspicious activity.

## Host-based intrusion detection system

A **[[host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS)]]** is an application that monitors the activity of the host on which it's installed. A HIDS is installed as an agent on a host. A host is also known as an **[[endpoint]]**, which is any device connected to a network like a computer or a server. 

Typically, HIDS agents are installed on all endpoints and used to monitor and detect security threats. A HIDS monitors internal activity happening on the host to identify any unauthorized or abnormal behavior. If anything unusual is detected, such as the installation of an unauthorized application, the HIDS logs it and sends out an alert. 

In addition to monitoring inbound and outbound traffic flows, HIDS can have additional capabilities, such as monitoring file systems, system resource usage, user activity, and more. 

This diagram shows a HIDS tool installed on a computer. The dotted circle around the host indicates that it is only monitoring the local activity on the single computer on which it’s installed.
