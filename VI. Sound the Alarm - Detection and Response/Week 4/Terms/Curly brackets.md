**[[Curly brackets]]** enclose an **object**, which is a data type that stores data in a comma-separated list of key-value pairs. Objects are often used to describe multiple properties for a given key. JSON log entries start and end with a curly bracket. In this example, `User` is the object that contains multiple properties:

```JSON
"User" 
{  
	"id": "1234",  
	"name": "user", 
	"role": "engineer" 
}
```
