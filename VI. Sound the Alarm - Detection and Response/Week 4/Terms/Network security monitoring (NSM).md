**[[Network security monitoring (NSM)]]**: In this mode, Suricata helps keep networks safe by producing and saving relevant network logs. Suricata can analyze live network traffic, existing packet capture files, and create and save full or conditional packet captures. This can be useful for forensics, incident response, and for testing signatures. For example, you can trigger an alert and capture the live network traffic to generate traffic logs, which you can then analyze to refine detection signatures.
