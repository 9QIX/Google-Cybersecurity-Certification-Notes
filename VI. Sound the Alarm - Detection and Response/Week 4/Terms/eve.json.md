**[[eve.json]]**: The eve.json file is the standard Suricata log file. This file contains detailed information and metadata about the events and alerts generated by Suricata stored in JSON format. For example, events in this file contain a unique identifier called flow_idÂ  which is used to correlate related logs or alerts to a single network flow, making it easier to analyze network traffic. The eve.json file is used for more detailed analysis and is considered to be a better file format for log parsing and SIEM log ingestion.
