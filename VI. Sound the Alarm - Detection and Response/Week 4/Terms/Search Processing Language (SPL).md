- **Different SIEM Search Methods:** Different SIEM tools use various search methods and query languages. For instance, Splunk utilizes its own query language called **[[Search Processing Language (SPL)]]**. SPL offers a range of search options to optimize results and retrieve the necessary data effectively.
	- **Search Example in Splunk:** An example of a raw log search in Splunk Cloud was demonstrated. The search query was designed to find events related to errors or failures in a fictional online store called Buttercup Games. The query used the index "buttercupgames" and specified search terms: "error OR fail*." The wildcard character ``"*"`` was used to account for variations in the term "fail." The search was further refined by selecting a specific time range, such as the last 30 days. The search results displayed a timeline and an events viewer, highlighting the search terms in matching events.
