# The importance of network traffic flows

- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Network traffic refers to the amount of data moving across a network, while network data is the actual data transmitted between devices on a network. In large organizations, there can be a massive volume of network traffic at any given time due to various activities, such as email communication.
- **Understanding Normal vs. Abnormal Traffic:** To identify potential security incidents, it's crucial to differentiate between normal and abnormal network traffic. The video uses a traffic analogy to explain that just as drivers understand expected traffic patterns based on their commuting experience, security professionals must understand how data should flow across the network to spot abnormalities. Observing network traffic helps identify Indicators of Compromise (IoC), which are observable evidence suggesting signs of a potential security incident.
- **Detecting Data Exfiltration:** Data exfiltration, which involves the unauthorized transmission of data from a system, is highlighted as an example of a security incident. Security professionals can use network traffic analysis to detect potential data exfiltration, such as large volumes of outbound traffic leaving a host. Such anomalies in network traffic patterns can indicate a data exfiltration attempt and prompt further investigation.
- **Importance of Monitoring Traffic:** Understanding and monitoring network traffic for inconsistencies are essential tasks for security professionals to identify potential security incidents and breaches.

The video effectively explains the concept of network traffic analysis and its role in identifying security incidents, using relatable analogies and examples. This knowledge is vital for security professionals in protecting communications and data in transit and at rest.
