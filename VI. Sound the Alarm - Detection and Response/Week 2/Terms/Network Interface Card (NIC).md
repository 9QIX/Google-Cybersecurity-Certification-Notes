First, packets must be collected from the network via the **[[Network Interface Card (NIC)]]**, which is hardware that connects computers to a network, like a router. NICs receive and transmit network traffic, but by default they only listen to network traffic that’s addressed to them. To capture all network traffic that is sent over the network, a NIC must be switched to a mode that has access to all visible network data packets. In wireless interfaces this is often referred to as monitoring mode, and in other systems it may be called promiscuous mode. This mode enables the NIC to have access to all visible network data packets, but it won’t help analysts access all packets across a network. A network protocol analyzer must be positioned in an appropriate network segment to access all traffic between different hosts.
