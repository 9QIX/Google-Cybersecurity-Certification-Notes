### **Capturing packets**

**[[Packet sniffing]]** is the practice of capturing and inspecting data packets across a network. A **[[packet capture (p-cap)]]** is a file containing data packets intercepted from an interface or network. Packet captures can be viewed and further analyzed using network protocol analyzers. For example, you can filter packet captures to only display information that's most relevant to your investigation, such as packets sent from a specific IP address.

**Note**: Using network protocol analyzers to intercept and examine private network communications without permission is considered illegal in many places.
