### **[[Temporal patterns]]**

Network packets contain information relating to time. This information is useful in understanding time patterns. For example, a company operating in North America experiences bulk traffic flows between 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., which is the baseline of normal network activity. If large volumes of traffic are suddenly outside of the normal hours of network activity, then this is considered _off baseline_ and should be investigated.

Through network monitoring, organizations can promptly detect network intrusions and work to prevent them from happening by securing network components.
