**[[Network protocol analyzers (packet sniffers)]]** are tools designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network. Examples of network protocol analyzers include tcpdump, Wireshark, and TShark. 

Beyond their use in security as an investigative tool used to monitor networks and identify suspicious activity, network protocol analyzers can be used to collect network statistics, such as bandwidth or speed, and troubleshoot network performance issues, like slowdowns. 

Network protocol analyzers can also be used for malicious purposes. For example, malicious actors can use network protocol analyzers to capture packets containing sensitive data, such as account login information.

Here’s a network diagram illustrating how packets get transmitted from a sender to the receiver. A network protocol analyzer is placed in the middle of the communications to capture the data packets that travel over the wire.
