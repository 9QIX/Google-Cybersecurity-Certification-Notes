**[[Payload]]**: which contains the actual data that's being delivered. This is like the content of a letter inside of an envelope. And there's the footer, which signifies the end of the packet.

The payload component directly follows the header and contains the actual data being delivered. Think back to the example of uploading an image to a website; the payload of this packet would be the image itself.
