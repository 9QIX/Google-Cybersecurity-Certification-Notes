This information can be valuable for security professionals when developing a **[[baseline]]** of normal or expected behavior.

A baseline is a reference point thatâ€™s used for comparison. You've probably encountered or used baselines at some point. For example, a grocery amount for a personal budget is an example of a baseline that can be used to help identify any patterns or changes in spending habits. In security, baselines help establish a standard of expected or normal behavior for systems, devices, and networks. Essentially, by knowing the baseline of _normal_ network behavior, you'll be better able to identify _abnormal_ network behavior.
