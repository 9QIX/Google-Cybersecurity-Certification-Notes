**[[Fragmentation]]** is when an IP packet gets broken up into chunks, which then get transmitted over the wire and reassembled when they arrive at their destination. These three fields specify if fragmentation has been used and how to reassemble the broken packets in the correct order. This is similar to how mail can travel through multiple routes like mailboxes, processing facilities, airplanes, and mail trucks before it reaches its destination.
