Previously in the program, you learned that a **[[data packet]]** is a basic unit of information that travels from one device to another within a network. Detecting network intrusions begins at the packet level. That's because packets form the basis of information exchange over a network. Each time you perform an activity on the internet—like visiting a website—packets are sent and received between your computer and the website’s server. These packets are what help transmit information through a network. For example, when uploading an image to a website, the data gets broken up into multiple packets, which then get routed to the intended destination and reassembled upon delivery. 

In cybersecurity, packets provide valuable information that helps add context to events during investigations. Understanding the transfer of information through packets will not only help you develop insight on network activity, it will also help you identify abnormalities and better defend networks from attacks.

Packets contain three components: the header, the payload, and the footer. Here’s a description of each of these components.
