**[[Network protocol analyzers]]**, also known as ***packet sniffers***, are tools designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network. They can be used to analyze network communications manually in detail. Examples include tools such as tcpdump and Wireshark, which can be used by security professionals to record network communications through packet captures. Packet captures can then be investigated to identify potentially malicious activity.
