### **[[Packet payload information]]**

Network packets contain components related to the transmission of the packet. This includes details like source and destination IP address, and the packet payload information, which is the actual data thatâ€™s transmitted. Often, this data is encrypted and requires decryption for it to be readable. Organizations can monitor the payload information of packets to uncover unusual activity, such as sensitive data transmitting outside of the network, which could indicate a possible data exfiltration attack.
