# Introduction to Linux, SQL, and Python

[[Programming]] to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks. Programming allows analysts to complete repetitive tasks and processes with a high degree of accuracy and efficiency. It also helps reduce the risk of human error, and can save hours or days compared to performing the work manually.

## OS and Programming Languages

- [[Linux]] - is an open-source, or publicly available, operating system. Unlike other operating systems you may be familiar with, for example MacOS or Windows, Linux relies on a command line as the primary user interface. Linux itself is not a programming language, but it does allow for the use of text-based commands between the user and the operating system.
	- A common use of Linux for entry-level security analysts is examining logs to better understand what's occurring in a system. For example, you might find yourself using commands to review an error log when investigating uncommonly high network traffic.
- [[Structured Query Language (SQL)]] - is a programming language used to create, interact with, and request information from a database. 
	- A [[Database]] is an organized collection of information or data. There may be millions of data points in a database. 
	- So an entry-level security analyst would use SQL to filter through the data points to retrieve specific information. 
- [[Python]] - Security professionals can use Python to perform tasks that are repetitive and time-consuming and that require a high level of detail and accuracy.
