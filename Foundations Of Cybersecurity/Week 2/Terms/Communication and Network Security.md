- #### [[Communication and Network Security]]
	- This domain focuses on *managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications*. 
	- As a security analyst, you may be asked to analyze user behavior within your organization.

## **[[Password Attack]]**

A **password attack** is an attempt to access password-secured devices, systems, networks, or data. Some forms of password attacks that you’ll learn about later in the certificate program are:  

- [[Brute Force]] - A method of attempting every possible combination or password until the correct one is found.
- [[Rainbow Table]] - A precomputed table used to quickly reverse cryptographic hash functions and recover original passwords.

Password attacks fall under the [[communication and network security]] domain. 

### **[[Cryptographic Attack]]**

A **cryptographic attack** affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient. Some forms of cryptographic attacks are: 

- [[Birthday]] - An attack that exploits the probability of two different inputs producing the same cryptographic hash value, potentially compromising security.
- [[Collision]] - A type of cryptographic attack that seeks to find two distinct inputs that produce the same hash value, undermining the integrity of hash functions.
- [[Downgrade]] - A tactic where an attacker forces a system or communication to use a weaker security protocol, making it susceptible to exploitation.
    
Cryptographic attacks fall under the [[communication and network security ]]domain.

### **[[Adversarial Artificial Intelligence]]**

**Adversarial artificial intelligence** is a technique that manipulates [artificial intelligence and machine learning](https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/ai/adversarial-machine-learning) technology to conduct attacks more efficiently. Adversarial artificial intelligence falls under both the communication and [[network security]] and the [[identity and access management]] domains.
