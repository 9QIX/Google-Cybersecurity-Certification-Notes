A **[[Hacker]]** is any person who uses computers to gain access to computer systems, networks, or data. They can be beginner or advanced technology professionals who use their skills for a variety of reasons. There are three main categories of hackers:

- Authorized hackers are also called [[Ethical Hackers]]. They follow a code of ethics and adhere to the law to conduct organizational risk evaluations. They are motivated to safeguard people and organizations from malicious threat actors.
- Semi-authorized hackers are considered [[Researchers]]. They search for vulnerabilities but don’t take advantage of the vulnerabilities they find.
- Unauthorized hackers are also called [[Unethical Hackers]]. They are malicious threat actors who do not follow or respect the law. Their goal is to collect and sell confidential data for financial gain. 

[[Threat actor]] and [[Hacker]] are technically skilled individuals. Understanding their motivations and intentions will help you be better prepared to protect your organization and the people it serves from malicious attacks carried out by some of these individuals and groups.
