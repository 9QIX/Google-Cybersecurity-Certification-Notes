## **[[Password Attack]]**

A **password attack** is an attempt to access password-secured devices, systems, networks, or data. Some forms of password attacks that you’ll learn about later in the certificate program are:  

- [[Brute Force]] - A method of attempting every possible combination or password until the correct one is found.
- [[Rainbow Table]] - A precomputed table used to quickly reverse cryptographic hash functions and recover original passwords.

Password attacks fall under the communication and network security domain.
