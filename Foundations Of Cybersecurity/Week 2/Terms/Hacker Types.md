A **[[Hacker]]** is any person who uses computers to gain access to computer systems, networks, or data. They can be beginner or advanced technology professionals who use their skills for a variety of reasons. There are three main categories of hackers:

- Authorized hackers are also called [[Ethical Hackers]]. They follow a code of ethics and adhere to the law to conduct organizational risk evaluations. They are motivated to safeguard people and organizations from malicious threat actors.
- Semi-authorized hackers are considered [[Researchers]]. They search for vulnerabilities but don’t take advantage of the vulnerabilities they find.
- Unauthorized hackers are also called [[Unethical Hackers]]. They are malicious threat actors who do not follow or respect the law. Their goal is to collect and sell confidential data for financial gain. 

**Note:** There are multiple hacker types that fall into one or more of these three categories.

New and unskilled threat actors have various goals, including: 

- To learn and enhance their hacking skills
- To seek revenge
- To exploit security weaknesses by using existing malware, programming scripts, and other tactics 

Other types of hackers are not motivated by any particular agenda other than completing the job they were contracted to do. These types of hackers can be considered **unethical or ethical hackers**. They have been known to work on both illegal and legal tasks for pay.

There are also hackers who consider themselves vigilantes. Their main goal is to protect the world from unethical hackers.
