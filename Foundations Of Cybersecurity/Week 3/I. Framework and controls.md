# Introduction to Security Frameworks and Controls

[[Security Frameworks]] are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy. Security frameworks provide a structured approach to implementing a security lifecycle. 

The [[Security Lifecycle]] is a constantly evolving set of policies and standards that define how an organization manages risks, follows established guidelines, and meets regulatory compliance, or laws.

There are several security frameworks that may be used to manage different types of organizational and regulatory compliance risks. 

### The purpose of security frameworks include protecting:
- Personally identifiable information, known as PII
- Securing financial information
- Identifying security weaknesses
- Managing organizational risks, and aligning security with business goals

### Framework Core Components

![[Pasted image 20230819191627.png]]

- **[[Identifying and Documenting Security Goals]]**
	- For example, an organization may have a goal to align with the E.U.'s General Data Protection Regulation, also known as GDPR. GDPR is a data protection law established to grant European citizens more control over their personal data. 
	- A security analyst may be asked to identify and document areas where an organization is out of compliance with GDPR.
- **[[Setting Guidelines to Achieve Security Goals]]**
	- For example, when implementing guidelines to achieve GDPR compliance, your organization may need to develop new policies for how to handle data requests from individual users.
- **[[Implementing Strong Security Processes]]**
	- In the case of GDPR, a security analyst working for a social media company may help design procedures to ensure the organization complies with verified user data requests. 
	- An example of this type of request is when a user attempts to update or delete their profile information.
- **[[Monitoring and Communicating Results]]**
	- As an example, you may monitor your organization's internal network and report a potential security issue affecting GDPR to your manager or regulatory compliance officer.

[[Frameworks]] allow analysts to work alongside other members of the security team to *document, implement, and use the policies and procedures* that have been created. It's essential for an entry-level analyst to understand this process because it directly affects the work they do and how they collaborate with others.

[[Security Controls]] are safeguards designed to *reduce specific security risks*. For example, your company may have a guideline that requires all employees to complete a privacy training to reduce the risk of data breaches. 

As a security analyst, you may use a software tool to automatically assign and track which employees have completed this training.

[[Security Frameworks and Controls]] are vital to managing security for all types of organizations and ensuring that everyone is doing their part to maintain a low level of risk.

# Secure Design

The **[[CIA Triad]]** is a foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies. 

CIA stands for [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]], and [[availability]].

- **[[Confidentiality]]** means that only authorized users can access specific assets or data. 
	- For example, strict access controls that define who should and should not have access to data, must be put in place to ensure confidential data remains safe.
- **[[Integrity]]** means the data is correct, authentic, and reliable. 
	- To maintain integrity, security professionals can use a form of data protection like encryption to safeguard data from being tampered with.
- **[[Availability]]** means data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.


An **[[Asset]]** is an item perceived as having value to an organization. And [[Value]] is determined by the cost associated with the asset in question.
	For example, an application that stores sensitive data, such as social security numbers or bank accounts, is a valuable asset to an organization. It carries more risk and therefore requires tighter security controls in comparison to a website that shares publicly available news content. 

**[[NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)]]** (NIST CSF)
A specific framework developed by the U.S.-based National Institute of Standards and Technology: the Cybersecurity Framework, also referred to as the NIST CSF. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a *voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk*.

It's important to become familiar with this framework because security teams use it as a baseline to manage short and long-term risk. 

Managing and mitigating risks and protecting an organization's assets from threat actors are key goals for security professionals. Understanding the different motives a threat actor may have, alongside identifying your organization's most valuable assets is important. 

Some of the most dangerous threat actors to consider are ***disgruntled employees***. They are the most dangerous because they often have access to sensitive information and know where to find it. 
	In order to reduce this type of risk, security professionals would use the ***principle of availability***, as well as organizational guidelines based on frameworks to ensure staff members can only access the data they need to perform their jobs.

[[Threat actor]] originate from all across the globe, and a diverse workforce of security professionals helps organizations identify attackers' intentions. A variety of perspectives can assist organizations in understanding and mitigating the impact of malicious activity.

# Controls, frameworks, and compliance

## How controls, frameworks, and compliance are related

The **confidentiality, integrity, and availability ([[CIA Triad]])** is a model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies. 

![Triangle illustrant la triade CIA (confidentialité, intégrité, disponibilité)](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/tRYBVP2USbGPopkOfhzPpw_6ab653e71a614420b313c9e7675893f1_PULBC_YPYaRtzxvZUx-luk79t2pB_kZEoF2XeW17w6D2BekL7XaIUhCIAf65kNzAZU-WXYJ6IwhMr_jwiPhYMd2kWk5TyfeNFUy4ax3hyj_fJbtGSEw4UB0bzaA-E-gKD5tG8yud6Q2kmQFomLoF4CGW-0cCnhAyOvriAcCqrRKDlJMkaNOReSToFqs5I_cjfFOVTU9cmwiYyFETx2_4Gbf80z4rpW3ioqxBAw?expiry=1692576000000&hmac=fnAmuHb7JzyLLr1Z041BsSH1qbcAQFMnrgtyhjwbnV0)

CIA are the three foundational principles used by cybersecurity professionals to ***establish appropriate controls that mitigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities***.

As you may recall, **security** **controls** are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. So they are used alongside frameworks to ensure that security goals and processes are implemented correctly and that organizations meet regulatory compliance requirements.

**[[Security frameworks]]** are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy. They have four core components:

1. [[Identifying and Documenting Security Goals]]
2. [[Setting Guidelines to Achieve Security Goals]] 
3. [[Implementing Strong Security Processes]]
4. [[Monitoring and Communicating Results]]

**[[Compliance]]** is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations.

## Specific controls, frameworks, and compliance

The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)]] is a U.S.-based agency that *develops multiple voluntary compliance frameworks that organizations worldwide can use to help manage risk*. The more aligned an organization is with compliance, the lower the risk.

Examples of frameworks include the [[NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)]]  and the [[NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)]]. 

**Note:** Specifications and guidelines can change depending on the type of organization you work for.

In addition to the [NIST CSF](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)and [NIST RMF](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/about-rmf), there are several other controls, frameworks, and compliance standards that it is important for security professionals to be familiar with to help keep organizations and the people they serve safe.

### **[[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission - North American Electric Reliability Corporation (FERC-NERC)]]**

FERC-NERC is a regulation that applies to organizations that work with *electricity* or that are *involved with the U.S. and North American power grid*. 

These types of organizations have an obligation to prepare for, mitigate, and report any potential security incident that can negatively affect the power grid. 

They are also legally required to adhere to the Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Reliability Standards defined by the FERC. 

### **[[Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP®)]]**

FedRAMP is a U.S. federal government program that standardizes security *assessment, authorization, monitoring, and handling of cloud services and product offerings*. 

Its purpose is to provide consistency across the government sector and third-party cloud providers. 

### **[[Center for Internet Security (CIS®)]]**

CIS is a nonprofit with multiple areas of emphasis. It provides a set of controls that can be used to safeguard systems and networks against attacks. 

Its purpose is to help organizations establish a better plan of defense. CIS also provides actionable controls that security professionals may follow if a security incident occurs. 

### **[[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)]]**

GDPR is a European Union (E.U.) general data regulation that protects the processing of E.U. residents’ data and their right to privacy in and out of E.U. territory. 

For example, if an organization is not being transparent about the data they are holding about an E.U. citizen and why they are holding that data, this is an infringement that can result in a fine to the organization. Additionally, if a breach occurs and an E.U. citizen’s data is compromised, they must be informed. The affected organization has 72 hours to notify the E.U. citizen about the breach.

### **[[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)]]**

PCI DSS is an international security standard meant to ensure that organizations storing, accepting, processing, and transmitting credit card information do so in a secure environment. The objective of this compliance standard is to reduce credit card fraud. 

### **[[The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)]]**

HIPAA is a U.S. federal law established in 1996 to protect patients' health information. This law prohibits patient information from being shared without their consent. It is governed by three rules: 

1. Privacy
2. Security 
3. Breach notification 

Organizations that store patient data have a legal obligation to inform patients of a breach because if patients' **Protected Health Information** (PHI) is exposed, it can lead to identity theft and insurance fraud. PHI relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual, whether it’s a plan of care or payments for care. Along with understanding HIPAA as a law, security professionals also need to be familiar with the Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST®), which is a security framework and assurance program that helps institutions meet HIPAA compliance.

### **[[International Organization for Standardization (ISO)]]** 

ISO was created to establish international standards related to technology, manufacturing, and management across borders. It helps organizations improve their processes and procedures for staff retention, planning, waste, and services. 

### **[[System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2)]]**

The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants® (AICPA) auditing standards board developed this standard. The SOC1 and SOC2 are a series of reports that focus on an organization's user access policies at different organizational levels such as: 

- Associate
- Supervisor
- Manager
- Executive
- Vendor
- Others 

They are used to assess an organization’s financial compliance and levels of risk. They also cover confidentiality, privacy, integrity, availability, security, and overall data safety. Control failures in these areas can lead to fraud.

**Pro tip**: There are a number of regulations that are frequently revised. You are encouraged to keep up-to-date with changes and explore more frameworks, controls, and compliance. Two suggestions to research: the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

## [[United States Presidential Executive Order 14028]]

On May 12, 2021, President Joe Biden released an executive order related to improving the nation’s cybersecurity to remediate the increase in threat actor activity. Remediation efforts are directed toward federal agencies and third parties with ties to U.S. [critical infrastructure](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/critical_infrastructure#:~:text=Definition(s)%3A,any%20combination%20of%20those%20matters.). For additional information, review the [Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/)
