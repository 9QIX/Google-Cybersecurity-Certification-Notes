This reading will focus on providing more tips to help you stay engaged with the security community and advance your career by engaging with the cybersecurity community. 

## LinkedIn® with CISOs

Earlier in the program, you learned about Chief Information Security Officers, also known as CISOs.  It’s their job to be up-to-date on every aspect of security, including all of the latest trends and news in the security world. With this in mind, it’s a great idea to follow CISOs on LinkedIn® professional networking services. When you follow a CISO on social media, you’ll have an opportunity to discover the kinds of information they share with their audience. That information might provide you with useful tips and relevant news. Staying informed about security news and trends can help progress your cybersecurity career because it helps sharpen your security mindset.

## Finding other security professionals on LinkedIn®

Whether you’d like to connect with other entry-level analysts or more seasoned professionals, LinkedIn® is a great way to connect with others. When connecting with others, it’s important to send a well-written message. This message can help the person understand your intentions. It also helps people determine that you’re not a scammer looking to exploit them. Here are a few tips to help you write your first message in a way that engages and interests the recipient: 

- Use a conversational tone.
- Provide a clear reason for wanting to connect.
- Avoid spelling and grammatical errors.

Here is an example of an effective LinkedIn® message to send to a security professional: 

_“Hi, Tim. I recently completed the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program, and I’d like to connect with other security professionals. It seems like you have a lot of experience in the security industry that I can learn from. Let’s keep in touch!”_ 

This example provides a clear reason for why you want to connect with this person and is presented in a conversational tone. You also did not give the impression that you are a scammer by asking the person to do something suspicious to connect with you, like downloading an unusual file attachment. 

## Key takeaways

Attackers are always developing new ways to compromise corporate and personal data. Connecting with other cybersecurity professionals on social media is a great way to stay ahead of the latest trends in security. CISOs are great professionals to connect with because they are responsible for all aspects of an organization's security. Because of that, CISOs tend to share important security tips, news, and trends on their social media pages that could be valuable to you as a newcomer to industry.
