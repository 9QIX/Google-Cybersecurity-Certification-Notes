# Prepare to escalate through security recognition

- **Overview of Incident Escalation:**
    - Definition: Previously discussed what it means to escalate an incident.
    - Skills: Previous discussion on the skills needed for proper incident escalation.
- **Incident Classification Types:**
    - Malware Infection
    - Unauthorized Access
    - Improper Usage
- **[[Malware Infection]]:**
    - Definition: Malicious software disrupting a system by infiltrating an organization's computers or network.
    - Forms: Various types discussed, including phishing attempts and ransomware attacks.
    - Impact: Slowed network speeds, potential data lockdown for ransom.
    - Significance: Especially impactful due to the sensitivity of data stored on an organization's network.
- **[[Unauthorized Access]]:**
    - Definition: Occurs when an individual gains digital or physical access to a system or application without permission.
    - Methods: Reference to brute force attacks discussed earlier in the program.
    - Escalation: All unauthorized access incidents are important to escalate; urgency depends on the criticality to the organization's business operations.
- **[[Improper Usage]]:**
    - Definition: Occurs when an employee violates the organization's acceptable use policies.
    - Complexity: Instances can be unintentional or intentional.
    - Decision-Making: Determining accidental or intentional acts can be difficult, hence escalation to a supervisor is recommended.
- **General Advice:**
    - Importance of knowing incident types and how to escalate them.
    - Acknowledgment that encountering various incident types is likely in the role of a security team member.

# Recognize roles and responsibilities during escalation

You previously learned about various incident classification types and how those incidents can impact an organization. 

This reading will discuss the roles of the various team members who are a part of the incident escalation process. Keep in mind that not all organizations are alike, and some roles and responsibilities may be identified using different terminology and definitions.  

## Data owners

A **[[data owner]]** is the person that decides who can access, edit, use, or destroy their information. Data owners have administrative control over specific information hardware or software and are accountable for the classification, protection, access, and use of company data. For example, consider a situation where an employee gains unauthorized access to software they do not need to use for work. This kind of security event would be escalated to the data owner of that software.

## Data controllers

**[[Data controllers]]** determine the procedure and purpose for processing data. This role largely focuses on collecting the personal information of customers. The data controller determines how that data is used. The data controller also ensures that data is used, stored, and processed in accordance with relevant security and privacy regulations. If sensitive customer information was at risk, that event would be escalated to data controllers.

## Data processors

**[[Data processors]]** report directly to the data controller and are responsible for processing the data on behalf of the data controller. The data processor is typically a vendor and is often tasked with installing security measures to help protect the data. Data processing issues are typically escalated to the individual who oversees the third-party organization responsible for data processing.

## Data custodians

**[[Data custodians]]** assign and remove access to software or hardware. Custodians are responsible for implementing security controls for the data they are responsible for, granting and revoking access to that data, creating policies regarding how that data is stored and transmitted, advising on potential threats to that data, and monitoring the data. Data custodians are notified when data security controls need to be strengthened or have been compromised.

## Data protection officers (DPOs)

**[[Data protection officers]]** are responsible for monitoring the internal compliance of an organization’s data protection procedures. These individuals advise the security team on the obligations required by the organization's data protection standards and procedures. They also conduct assessments to determine whether or not the security measures in place are properly protecting the data as necessary. DPOs are notified when set standards or protocols have been violated.  

## Key takeaways

Incident escalation requires various members of a security team to act as one. Entry-level analysts should be familiar with the roles and responsibilities of different team members on the security team. As an entry-level analyst, you will typically escalate incidents to your direct supervisor. However, it’s still important to have an understanding of the different team members as you move forward in your security career because it will help you recognize which incidents should be reported to whom.
