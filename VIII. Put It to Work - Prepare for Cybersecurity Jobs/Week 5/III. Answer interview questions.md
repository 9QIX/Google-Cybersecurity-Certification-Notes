# Apply the STAR method during interviews

You’ve been learning about different techniques and strategies to use during future interviews for jobs in the cybersecurity field. In this reading, you’ll learn more details about the STAR method for answering interview questions. Implementing this strategy will help you answer interview questions with confidence and clarity.

## The STAR method

![[Pasted image 20231126205246.png]]

When interviewing for a job, it can be challenging to convey the right details about your professional history and skills to your interviewers. Using the STAR method can help you share your success stories effectively and strategically. STAR stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result. Using this method enables you to describe potential challenges you faced in previous roles and gives you the opportunity to show how you thoughtfully approached solving those problems from start to finish. 

### **Situation**

The **[[situation]]** is the project you worked on or a challenge that you had to overcome. For example, perhaps you had to manage a disgruntled customer’s negative feedback about your company,  a system error on your work device that slowed down a customer transaction, or being left alone in the office for an extended period of time. Fully describing the situation allows the interviewer to gain a clear understanding of the challenge you had to overcome.  

### **Task**

The **[[task]]** outlines the key responsibilities or role you played in solving the challenge described in the situation phase of the STAR method. Specifying what the task is provides clarity about what your objectives were in this scenario.

### **Action** 

The **[[action]]** describes the exact steps you took to resolve the challenging situation you described in the beginning of the STAR method. The action is crucial to the STAR method because it allows the employer to understand what choices you made to achieve your desired outcome during a real conflict or challenge. Employers want employees who can think fast and make decisions that help solve problems. 

### **Result**

Finally, sharing the **[[result]]** of your challenge or example shows the employers how the situation was resolved as a direct result of the actions you took. When participating in an interview, you want to make sure that any example you give with the STAR method ends in a positive result. Positive results show an employer that you are someone who has demonstrated an ability to successfully resolve issues and may lead an employer to offer you a job. Of course, not all situations have completely positive outcomes; if an employer asks you about a situation that didn’t have a positive outcome, try to focus on what you learned from the situation and how that experience helped you become a better employee. 

## Key takeaways

The STAR method stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result. Following this method helps you communicate to an employer an example of a challenge you faced in the workplace. Remember to use one of your success stories when using the STAR method on an interview. Challenges arise all the time in the security world, so being able to demonstrate an ability to overcome any type of challenge is a great trait to show off during an interview. Plus, since cybersecurity is such a team-driven industry, being able to communicate effectively to an interviewer will help you be a competitive applicant.

# Common Behavioral Interview Questions for Cybersecurity Analysts

1. Describe an experience advising and working with internal business units on security related issues. How did you meet with teams, address questions, encourage compliance, and help ensure optimal productivity?
2. Describe an experience in which you implemented a security solution. What was your solution, how did you help with implementation, and what were the results?
3. Describe an experience in which you used your cybersecurity skills effectively. How did you analyze variables and identify anomalies to improve security and productivity for your company?
4. Tell me about a time when an update in the field of information security, cybersecurity, or regulatory compliance took you by surprise. What was this update and how did you learn of it? What do you do today to stay up-to-date on relevant information?
5. Describe an experience in which you used technical security tools as part of issue resolution. How did you assess the issues and reach the conclusion that these tools represented the optimal solution? What was the outcome?
6. Describe an experience in which you had to plan, develop, execute, and/or maintain documentation related to security processes and procedures.
7. Tell me about a time you had to work across various internal teams on security tasks. How did you plan and arrange appropriate times to meet and mutually acceptable timelines across these teams? What was the outcome?
8. Describe an experience in which a security leak or other issue called for immediate response, analysis, and action. How did you organize and execute this while prioritizing and dealing with other duties disrupted by this event? What was the outcome?
9. Tell me about a time you had to speak to higher management in your role as a cybersecurity analyst about complex technical issues and solutions. How did you express highly technical information in a way that could be understood and responded to effectively?
10. Tell me about a time you experienced reluctance on the part of some members of higher management with regard to a security or regulatory issue. How did you go about gaining support for your opinions, whom did you speak with, and what was the outcome?

# Prepare for interviews

Great news! You’ve submitted your application and received a follow-up email requesting an interview.  The work isn’t over yet, though—you still have a lot of preparation to do. That’s what you’re going to learn about in this reading!

## Prepare for the introductory call

It’s important to showcase your best self in the introductory phone call. In this conversation, you’ll talk with the recruiter or hiring manager about yourself, the kind of work or training you have, and why you want the job. You might also be asked specifically about your salary requirements. For this question, it’s a good idea to prepare in advance and conduct an internet search for “average salary for entry-level security analysts.” 

### **Do your research**

Make sure you’ve done your research on the company. When the interviewer asks why you’d be a good fit for the job, they want to learn why you’re interested in cybersecurity and why you want to work at that company specifically. 

## Prepare for the second round

Your second-round interview will focus more on what you can offer as an entry-level security analyst. You’ll likely discuss yourself here, too, but you’ll also be going into detail about your knowledge of the profession. You’ll want to cover the same material you prepared for your introductory call, but you’ll also need to fully review your accomplishments in the security industry. Don’t worry if you have no prior professional cybersecurity experience. You can discuss the information you’ve learned in this certificate program. 

Depending on where you and your interviewer are located, the second-round interview might be over the phone, via video conference, or in person. In-person interviews often last an hour or so, but if you traveled for your interview or the company likes to bring candidates in for all of the remaining interview stages at once, you might complete your panel interview with a group that day as well.

### **Panel interview**

During the panel interview, you’ll meet with two or more people and discuss yourself and your ability to contribute to the organization. If you’re nervous about this, remind yourself that the team brought you in for the interview for a reason. When you feel confident in your abilities, you’re better able to showcase your knowledge about the security industry and demonstrate your ability to work well with a team. 

Be sure to engage with each panelist by giving them your full attention during the interview. Maintaining eye contact can help you express confidence, but for those who cannot do so, actively engaging with each panelist in your own way is just as important. 

It’s likely that each panelist will ask you at least one question during the interview. It’s okay to address the whole panel when answering a question, rather than only directing your response to the person who asked the question.
