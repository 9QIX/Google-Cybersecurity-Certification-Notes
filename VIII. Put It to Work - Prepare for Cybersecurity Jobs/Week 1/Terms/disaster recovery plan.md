## Disaster recovery plan

A **[[disaster recovery plan]]** allows an organization’s security team to outline the steps needed to minimize the impact of a security incident, such as a successful ransomware attack that has stopped the manufacturing team from retrieving certain data. It also helps the security team resolve the security threat. A disaster recovery plan is typically created alongside a business continuity plan. Steps to create a disaster recovery plan should include:

- Implementing recovery strategies to restore software  
- Implementing recovery strategies to restore hardware functionality
- Identifying applications and data that might be impacted after a security incident has taken place
